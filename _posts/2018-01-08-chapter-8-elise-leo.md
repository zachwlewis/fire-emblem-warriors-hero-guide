Hi everyone! Today’s guide is on the youngest Nohrian royal siblings: Elise and Leo.

## Basic info

### Elise

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   770 |
| Str  |    13 |
| Mag  |   144 |
| Skl  |    67 |
| Spe  |   127 |
| Lck  |   136 |
| Def  |    53 |
| Res  |   184 |

Elise is probably the best representation of a cleric in FE Warriors. Her Magic, Luck, Speed, and especially Resistance are all outstanding. However, her HP, Defense, Skill, and especially Strength are rather poor. Despite her relative frailty (except against magic wielders), her offensive capabilities are incredibly high.

#### Staff

#### Unique Weapon

Moonlight: no 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th slot

#### Unique Skill

Res +10: increases Resistance stat by 10.

### Leo

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   926 |
| Str  |    73 |
| Mag  |   134 |
| Skl  |    89 |
| Spe  |    92 |

| Def  |    61 |
| Res  |   171 |

Compared to his sister, Leo has a bit less raw offense, significantly less Luck, and a much higher HP pool. He is overall the bulkiest tome user (61 defense is still kinda bad though), but outside of Magic and Resistance his stat spread is overall a bit mediocre. He doesn’t manage to stand out in any significant way when compared to Elise or Robin aside from being the “safest” pick in terms of overall damage taken.

#### Staff

Never

#### Unique Weapon

Brynhildr: no 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th slot

#### Unique Skill

Mag +10: Increases Magic stat by 10.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

## Moveset

_Note that `C1` charges by damaging enemies with basic and strong combos._

**`Y1` (Dash):** The unit jumps forward, spinning a ball of energy around themselves. This is a nice gapcloser that can also be used to clear a small area while going from place to place.

**`C1` (0-49% charged):** Standard: The unit conjures a small energy ball in front of them that does damage to nearby enemies in front. Dashing: The energy ball lasts a longer time. It’s certainly not as bad as Robin’s uncharged `C1`, but still by far the worst skill in their kit.

**`C1` (50-99% charged):** Standard: The unit conjures a large energy ball that draws in foes before exploding, revealing a white stun gauge on all enemies hit. Dashing: The unit dives forward before doing the same attack. Like with Robin, this skill can be useful when there’s just no trash around to charge on, but generally you want to fully charges.

**`C1`: (100% charged):** Standard: The unit conjures a large energy ball that draws in foes before exploding into a flurry of tiny energy balls. All enemies hit have a yellow stun gauge revealed. Dashing: The unit dives forward before doing the same attack. Now, while this isn’t quite as good as Robin’s 100% `C1`, it’s still absolutely fantastic. The ability to expose a yellow stun gauge pretty much whenever you want is superb, and they charge it just as fast as Robin, if not faster.

**`C2`:** The unit conjures a tornado that launches enemies in front. This is actually pretty essential to breaking white gauges as their `C5` is inconsistent when it comes to juggling.

**`C3`:** The unit conjures a field of spikes beneath them, which then spins, dealing damage to nearby enemies. This is a pretty mediocre crowd clearer, if I’m being blunt. Their regular string, `C4`, and `C6` are much better at that.

**`C4`:** The unit conjures a huge fireball and shoots it at the ground a short distance away from them, which deals damage over a large area. This combo is wonderful at clearing crowds so long as they are in front of the unit.

**`C5`:** The unit conjures a ring of horizontal lasers in front of them that slowly shrinks towards the center. When the lasers converge, they explode, dealing damage in a small area around them. The unit can rotate while the lasers are firing to aim them. I have some mixed feelings about this combo. It does a high amount of damage to the units it hits, but when it comes to juggling officers, it too often drops the juggle before breaking the gauge. `C5`s typically do that very well, so it’s a bit disappointing in that regard.

**`C6`:**  The unit conjures a large dome of lightning that damages all enemies inside. After a few seconds, it explodes, damaging enemies in a large area (including a moderate distance outside the dome). This is a fantastic damage dealer and crowd clearer- just what you’d expect from a `C6`. It’s basically a `C3` that is much larger and is usable against officers.

## Weapon Builds

### Elise

- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**

Six weapon slot syndrome strikes again. Choose your favorite between **Strong I** and V. I considered listing IV as well, but ultimately that move is for clearing trash, so a damage boost isn’t strictly necessary. `C6` is her highest damage and most versatile combo. Her basic attack string is pretty great, so **Rainstorm** is a must. For the slayers, choose whichever two please you. **Wingslayer** is the best choice, and the other two are roughly equal. I excluded **Plateslayer** this time since mages are naturally **Strong vs** Armors. For your 5k slot, it’s your choice between **Pair Up+** and Crit+. Despite Elise’s low skill, her `C6` means she will be critting a lot, so the boost will be nice to have. I think **Pair Up+** is the better option though.

### Leo

- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**

Literally the exact same thing as Elise, for the exact same reasons. His Skill is higher, so he makes better use of Crit+ than her. Also, since their choices for slayer skills are generally limited by their class, it’s ok to overlap a bit for these two.

## Boost skills

### Elise

| Skill          | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Astra**      | **Ryoma**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Luna**       | **Chrom**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Trample**    | **Camilla** | **X** | **X** |
| Armored Blow   | Tiki        |   X   |       |
| Pass           | Lyn         |   X   |       |
| Luck +20       | Celica      |   X   |   X   |
| Mag +10        | Leo         |   X   |   X   |
| Def +10        | Hinoka      |   X   |   X   |
| Skill +10      | Takumi      |   X   |       |
| Live To Serve  | Lianna      |   X   |   X   |
| Solidarity     | Robin       |   X   |   X   |
| Dracoshield    | Corrin      |   X   |   X   |
{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- Just like with Robin, the mounted mage moveset is slooooooow. Astra increases their viablility quite a bit.
- At maximum Luck, Elise’s Luna reduces foes’ Def/Res by roughly 48%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Luck +20 (Celica), Mag +10 (Leo), Def +10 (Hinoka), Skill +10 (Takumi), Live to Serve (Lianna), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- Armored Blow is really necessary on a player controlled Elise, because you really don’t want your `C1` getting interrupted. Pass is pretty nifty too.
- With Luck +20, Elise’s Luna reduces foes’ Def/Res by 53%
- Mag +10 boosts her flat damage, Def +10 can help patch her terrible Defense, and Skill +10 can bolster her crits, as she will be doing that a lot.
- Live to Serve gives her a sustain option if you feel you need one.
- As she is a mounted unit, she will often be ferrying foot units from place to place. For that reason, Solidarity and Dracoshield are quite helpful.

#### Support Skills

Luck +20 (Celica), Mag +10 (Leo), Def +10 (Hinoka), Live to Serve (Lianna), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- Run the stat boosters if she is going to be fighting lots of enemies.
- Run the Pair Up skills if she’s going to be a stat backpack/dual guarder.
- Live to Serve is a good skill to have for any AI Elise.

### Leo

| Skill          | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Astra**      | **Ryoma**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Luna**       | **Chrom**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Trample**    | **Camilla** | **X** | **X** |
| Armored Blow   | Tiki        |   X   |       |
| Pass           | Lyn         |   X   |       |
| Luck +20       | Celica      |   X   |   X   |
| Mag +10        | Leo         |   X   |   X   |
| Def +10        | Hinoka      |   X   |   X   |
| Skill +10      | Takumi      |   X   |       |
| Potent Potion  | Rowan       |   X   |   X   |
| Solidarity     | Robin       |   X   |   X   |
| Dracoshield    | Corrin      |   X   |   X   |
| Live To Serve  | Lianna      |       |   X   |

- Just like with Robin, the mounted mage moveset is slooooooow. Astra increases their viablility quite a bit.
- At maximum Luck, Leo’s Luna reduces foes’ Def/Res by roughly 39%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Luck +20 (Celica), Mag +10 (Leo), Def +10 (Hinoka), Skill +10 (Takumi), Potent Potion (Rowan), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- Pass, Mag +10, Def +10, Solidarity, and Dracoshield were covered sufficiently in Elise’s section.
- Reminder that Armored Blow is really important for the mounted mages.
- With Luck +20, his Luna will reduce foes’ Def/Res by 44%.
- His Skill is better than Elise’s, so he uses it even better than she does- every little point counts.
- Potent Potion lets him backup heal.

#### Support Skills

Luck +20 (Celica), Mag +10 (Leo), Def +10 (Hinoka), Live to Serve (Lianna), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- Run the Pair Up skills if he’s going to be a stat backpack/dual guarder.
- Potent Potion lets him heal his buddies.

## Conclusion

Elise and Leo are amazing characters. They combine the amazing mage moveset with the utility of having a mount. In my opinion, if you only want to invest in one, invest in Elise. Her offensive capabilities are just way higher than his. Even with Luck +20 and a +Luck A support, his Luna (and by proxy, his non-crit damage) does not match Elise’s, even if she doesn’t have Luck boosts. The roughly 20 points of Skill he has over her mean a lot less than the almost 40 Luck she has over him. His only true benefit is his bulk, but with 50 Defense he’s still going to get clapped by physical attackers. However, although I just bagged on Leo a bit, he is still a great character that is more than viable if you like him more than Elise (like I do).
