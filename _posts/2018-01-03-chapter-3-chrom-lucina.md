Hi everyone! Today’s guide will be on the father/daughter dream team, Chrom and Lucina.

## Basic info

### Chrom

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   902 |
| Str  |   121 |
| Mag  |    25 |
| Skl  |   132 |
| Spe  |   132 |
| Lck  |   103 |
| Def  |   120 |
| Res  |    89 |
{: .table .table-sm .stats}

Chrom has got a really nice, well balanced stat spread. He doesn’t have many wasted points in Magic, which means both his regular attacks and warrior specials/crits are rather potent without having to sacrifice much bulk. His Luck and Resistance are his lowest relevant stats, but even they are solid. There’s not much else to say really — he’s strong and durable.

#### Staff

Never

#### Unique Weapon

Falchion: **Dracoslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Luna: has a chance to lower an enemy’s Def/Res on hit. Reduction increases with Luck (3 points of Luck for 1% increase).

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Speed (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

### Lucina

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   850 |
| Str  |   113 |
| Mag  |    28 |
| Skl  |   126 |
| Spe  |   141 |
| Lck  |   134 |
| Def  |    92 |
| Res  |    87 |
{: .table .table-sm .stats}

Of all the characters who share movesets in this game, Chrom and Lucina are by far the most similar. Lucina’s stat spread is not that different from Chrom’s. Unfortunately, it’s not as good. What she does have is much higher luck and slightly more speed and magic, in exchange for… a little of everything else. This Luck lead she has over him is quite significant though, giving her Luna roughly 57% Def/Res reduction on hit compared to his roughly 48%. This means that her damage is actually higher than his so long as Luna is proccing.

#### Staff

Never

#### Unique Weapon

Parallel Falchion: **Dracoslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Awakening: Increases damage while in Awakening mode.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Speed (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

_Note that `C1` charges by holding `X`._

**`C1`:** Charged: The unit lunges forward, dealing a small amount of damage and breaking through guards. Fully charged: The unit lunges forward, unleashing a horizontal energy wave that does moderate damage to enemies it passes through over a long distance. Full disclosure: I am not a fan of charging `C1`s. The drawbacks of standing still for even a few seconds to charge far outweigh the benefits in my eyes. To this combo’s credit, it is their longest range attack by far, but that isn’t enough to make it worth using in my eyes.

**`C2`:** The unit quickly swpies upwards with their sword while moving forward. This is your launcher. It’s somewhat spammable, but unfortunately enemies in this game break out of juggles rather quickly unless a stun gauge is up.

**`C3`:** The unit spins and then slashes, doing damage to nearby enemies in a horizontal arc. This is an ok crowd clearer but is somewhat lacking in range.

**`C4`:** The unit jumps in the air and spins downward, causing moderately sized lightning explosion that knocks back and reveals the stun gauge of any unit that doesn’t have WTA over them. This is a solid area clearer with the typical `C4` utility.

**`C5`:** The unit slashes quickly three times, and a fourth time in a large arc. This is your stun gauge smasher for enemies that can’t be juggled, like mounted units and armors.

**`C6`:** The unit throws their sword into the air and jumps after it, carrying up any nearby enemies, and then dives down causing a huge lightning explosion. This is quite easily their best combo, offering both crowd clearing and yellow stun gauge smashing if the enemy can be launched.

## Weapon Builds

### Chrom

- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Plateslayer**, **Wingslayer**, **Mountslayer**
- Choose one: **Warrior+**, **Critical+**, **Pair Up+**
- Choose one: **Antitriangle**, **Strong II**, **Strong IV**, **Awaken Gift**

**Strong V** and VI are your two main combos, and **Rainstorm** is **Rainstorm**. Since Chrom has access to **True Power**, you can choose a slayer skill. **Wingslayer** has a bit of redundancy with **Dracoslayer**, but covers a poor matchup. Personally, I would go with **Plateslayer** or **Mountslayer** and leave the Wingslaying to a sword unit that doesn’t have a Falchion. Chrom has fairly high Skill, so **Warrior+** and **Critical+** are good options, and **Pair Up+** is always good. None of these stand out as the best for him, so choose your favorite/whatever you have on hand. For your last slot, you have a bit of a choice. The easiest way to differentiate Chrom and Lucina is to give one of them **Antitriangle**, so I strongly recommend giving it to one of them. Personally, I gave it to Chrom, and I will detail why when I get to Lucina. Your other options are the spammable **Strong II**, **Strong IV** for the stun gauge exposer, and **Awaken Gift** if you’re into that kind of thing.

### Lucina

- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Plateslayer**, **Wingslayer**, **Mountslayer**
- Choose one: **Warrior+**, **Critical+**, **Pair Up+**
- Choose one: **Antitriangle**, **Awaken Gift**, **Strong II**, **Strong IV**

She’s basically the same as Chrom, so it stands to reason that her weapon build is going to be the same too. For your slayer, choose one that you didn’t give to Chrom. Lucina’s Skill is ever so slightly worse than Chrom’s, so **Pair Up+** is an ever so slightly better option for Lucina, but she still has a lot of Skill so any of these will do (I run Crit+ on mine, personally). For your last slot, if you don’t want to run **Strong II** or IV, **Awaken Gift** is a rather appealing option. Lucina’s Speed is the third highest of any sword unit, meaning her Awakening mode lasts the third longest of any sword unit. Ryoma, however, really has no room for **Awaken Gift** as he can and should run two slayers, and while Lyn can run a similar build, she has to pay extra for the Awakening boost skill. If you want, you can turn Lucina into a pseudo Tiki, using her high speed and **Awaken Gift** to stay in Awakening mode for as long as possible.

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- These skills need no introduction, being the three most reliable damage boosting skills in the game. They are good on everyone all the time.
- At maximum Luck, Luna will reduce foes' Def/Res by roughly 41%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Str +10 (Lissa), Luck + 20 (Celica), Awakening (Lucina), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Potent Potion (Rowan)

- Armored Blow is a wonderful skill on pretty much any player-controlled unit.
- Pass is nifty and can help approach tricky targets like archers and mages.
- Str +10 is a flat damage booster.
- At maximum Luck, Aegis and Pavise will reduce damage taken by the relevant weapons by roughly 28%.
- Luck +20 will increase his Luna Def/Res reduction to roughly 46%, and Aegis/Pavise damage reduction to 35%.
- Awakening is an ok option for any player controlled unit.
- Potent Potion is an option for History maps where you might want a backup healer.

#### Support Skills

Str +10 (Lissa), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Potent Potion (Rowan), Sol (Cordelia)

- Str + 10, Aegis, Pavise, and Potent Potion were covered sufficiently in the above section.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are worth running if you plan on having Chrom as a pair up buddy.
- Sol can allow Chrom to put his high Luck to use while battling officers in the field, taking the heat off of your healers a bit.

### Lucina

| Skill         | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------ | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Astra**     | **Ryoma**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Luna**      | **Chrom**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Trample**   | **Camilla** | **X** | **X** |
| Armored Blow  | Tiki        |   X   |       |

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- These skills need no introduction, being the three most reliable damage boosting skills in the game. They are good on everyone all the time.
- At maximum Luck, her Luna will reduce foes' Def/Res by roughly 48%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Str +10 (Lissa), Luck + 20 (Celica), Awakening (Lucina), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Potent Potion (Rowan)

- Armored Blow, Pass, Str +10, and Potent Potion were covered sufficiently in Chrom's section
- At max Luck, Aegis and Pavise reduce damage taken vs the relevant weapons by roughly 37%.
- Luck +20 increases Luna's Def/Res reduction to roughly 53%, and Aegis/Pavise's damage reduction to roughly 43%.
- Awakening and Speed +10 are for the Pseudo-Tiki set. If you decide to run **Awaken Gift** on Lucina, definitely run Awakening. Speed +10 is kinda mediocre, only adding 1 second to her Awakening duration. It is important to note that when in Awakening mode, you have the effects of Armored Blow and Pass regardless of if you have those skills equipped, so you do not need them if you are going for the Awakening build.

#### Support Skills

Str +10 (Lissa), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Potent Potion (Rowan), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Sol (Cordelia)

- See Chrom’s section for further details on when to use these skills.

## Final Notes

That about does it for this guide! Chrom and Lucina are the brawlers of the sword units, being able to take hits and dish them back out.  Given their solid stat spreads and reliable moveset, they’re a solid pick for any team, only truly lacking in ranged options. A couple final notes: be sure to run **Antitriangle** on one of these two, as it is not only the best way to differentiate them, but it also gives you more weapon triangle control on the whole. Bear in mind as well that Lucina does not have to run the Pseudo-Tiki build either, and indeed running a more standard set will probably deliver more consistent results. However, it seems to be the direction the devs wanted players to take her, and it can help her to carve out a niche of her own on your roster.
