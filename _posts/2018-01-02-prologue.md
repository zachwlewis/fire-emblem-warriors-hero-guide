A few notes before we begin.

First, my opinions are based mostly on my observations and experience with the game. While I have spent a lot of time playing, I don’t have hard numbers to give you, so what little I will give you is based on what I’ve read. On a similar note, if anyone does have things like damage calcs that they would like to use to refute or back up any claims I make, please feel free to do so.

Second, this guide assumes that all combo and weapon rank badges are unlocked, including **True Power** badges for those who have them. On a related note, if a character has a unique weapon, that is what the weapon build will be for. If they don’t, use a 5 star, 6 slot Brave weapon. Finally, I will be using the `C(X)` notation to discuss combos. For example, `C4` would refer to the combo `YYYX`, while `C1` would refer to just `X`.

I’d like to give a huge shoutout to [u/Graph066](https://www.reddit.com/user/graph066) for letting me know how damage is calculated and how boost skills interact with those calculations.
