Hi everyone! Today’s guide is on one of the trio of lords from Blazing Blade, Lyn.

## Basic Info

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   829 |
| Str  |   117 |
| Mag  |    44 |
| Skl  |   136 |
| Spe  |   148 |
| Lck  |   117 |
| Def  |    98 |
| Res  |    82 |

Lyn decided to pick up a Strength growth on the way to Aytolis, sporting a solid 117 total. Her other relevant offensive stats are solid too, with a great 136 Skill and a solid 96 Luck. Her bulk is pretty average — not as high as some of the bruisers of the cast, but far from a glass cannon. Her Speed is also outstanding, although Speed itself isn’t too useful.

#### Staff

Never

#### Unique Weapon

Sol Katti: **Dracoslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Pass: The unit’s movement cannot be stopped by enemy attacks.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Speed (+5 if A/A+, +3 otherwise)

## Moveset

**`C1`:** Lyn quickly dashes forward a decent distance. This is a nice gapcloser, but not much else.

**`C2`:** Lyn leaps into the air while slashing enemies in front, launching enemies hit. While airborne, she can use “Y” to use basic attacks as she falls, or “X” to slam directly down onto the ground. If you want to begin a juggle, just let Lyn drop.

**`C3`:** Lyn spins forward a short distance and then slashes vertically. This is a nice short range crowd clearer that is quite spammable.

**`C4`:** Lyn dashes straight up into the air in a zig-zag pattern, then uses both of her blades to slash in an “X” formation. This combo renders her airborne, where she has the same options as detailed in `C2`. This combo also exposes the stun gauge on any foe that doesn’t have WTA over her. This one is a bit tricky, but if you let Lyn drop immediately after the “X” slash, she can then immediately start juggling whatever unlucky officer got their stun gauge exposed.

**`C5`:** Lyn spins forward up to 5 times with each press of the `X` button, finishing it off with a diagonal slash. This combo is an ok stun gauge breaker, but where it really shines is the amount of agency you have in deciding just how far you want her to go while attacking. She can clear a very long distance with all 5 `X` presses, making it a great crowd clearer as she moves from place to place. With fewer `X` presses, she can use it to duel officers without leaving them behind.

**`C6`:** Lyn leaps into the air and dashes in multiple directions faster than the eye can follow. Enemies hit are dragged up into the air with her in the center of the area she is dashing. She finishes the combo with a giant slash in an “X” formation, dealing a huge amount of damage to enemies hit. This combo is utterly fantastic, up there with the best of them. `C6` allows Lyn to clear huge crowds while focusing down multiple officers at a time.

## Weapon Skills

- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Plateslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**, **Warrior+**
- Choose one: **Antitriangle**, **Awaken Gift**, **Strong IV**, **Strong III**

`C5` and `C6` are pretty great skills, so boost those for sure. Choose your slayer skill of choice- Plate or **Wingslayer** if you don’t take **Antitriangle**, and **Mountslayer** if you do. **Pair Up+** is the best damage booster, though **Critical+** synergizes very well with her high Skill and tendency to crit, and **Warrior+** is also a solid choice. For her final slot, **Antitriangle** is a very solid choice, but if you don’t want to use that, **Awaken Gift** can help her take advantage of her high Speed. **Strong IV** and III are also solid choices if you like those combos.

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- Armored Blow is a fantastic skill for Lyn, or just about anyone really. You can also use Pass, though `C1` more or less makes it obsolete.
- At maximum Luck, Aegis and Pavise reduce damage taken vs the relevant weapons by 32%.
- With Luck +20, Luna’s Def/Res reduction increases to roughly 329% and Aegis/Pavise’s damage reduction increases to roughly 39%.
- Str +10 is a flat damage boost, while Skill +10 boosts her already potent critical hits.
- Awakening is a good option to take advantage of Lyn’s high speed.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are great skills if you plan on frequently pair swapping.
- Potent Potion allows Lyn to be a backup healer.

#### Support Skills

Luck +20 (Celica), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Str +10 (Lissa), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Potent Potion (Rowan)

- These skills were covered sufficiently above.

## Conclusion

If Marth and Celica’s moveset is focused on speedy strikes, then Lyn has cut the brakes entirely. While adjusting to Astra she feels nigh uncontrollable, but after a few battles of practice, she becomes a powerful and precise hurricane of a unit. She doesn’t lack in any particular area, has a very flexible weapon build, and her moveset has an answer for every situation. She can juggle, gapclose, crowd clear… you get the picture. I was overjoyed when she got announced for the game, as she is one of my favorite characters in the whole series, and I was especially thrilled to see just how effective she is on the battlefield. She’s definitely one of the best characters in the game, and I strongly recommend investing in her.
