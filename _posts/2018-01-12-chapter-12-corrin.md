Hi everyone! Today’s guide is on the shapeshifting main character of Fates, Corrin.

## Basic Info

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |

| Spe  |   103 |
| Lck  |   123 |

Corrin has a very well rounded stat pool, to the point that there’s really not a whole lot to say about it. Every one of their stats is roughly average/above average with the only standout being their Luck. It’s not bad, but it’s not amazing either.

## Moveset

_Note that Corrin’s `C1` charges by holding the `X` button._

**`C1` (uncharged):** Corrin roars at the sky and stabs forward with a lance arm. This doesn’t really do anything (it may guard break but I couldnt get it to work) and the startup frames are not helpful in the slightest.

**`C1` (fully charged):** Corrin transforms into a dragon, rears up on their hind legs, and slams down on the ground, damaging enemies in an area round them. A bad combo, considering the charge time and relatively small area it hits compared to their other combos.

**`C2`:** Corrin jabs upward, launching foes in front of them. A solid launcher. Combo it after `C4` to start juggles.

**`C3`:** Corrin lunges forward and then slashes in a wide arc. This attack comes out fairly quickly and hits a surprisingly large area. Be wary of the forward momentum while using it, but this is a solid crowd clearer.

**`C4`:** Corrin spins around on their lance arm and kicks forward, exposing the stun gauge on any foe that doesn’t have WTA over them. All skills that have this effect are useful, but with that said, the forward kick can be really disorienting and you need to be quick sometimes to take advantage of the gauge you exposed.

**`C5`:** Corrin jumps in the air and stabs the ground with their lance arm. They then jump further into the air and slam down onto the ground with a claw arm, dealing damage in a moderate area around the landing spot. This combo is pretty good. It’s definitely their best close combat combo and it does a good amount of damage in a respectable area while also being a good stun gauge breaker.

**`C6`:** Corrin transforms into a dragon, charges forward, leaps straight up into the air, and then slams down onto the ground. This AoE on this combo is pretty massive, and it does some good damage too. It doesn’t come out as quickly as `C3`, but it makes up for that with the AoE and superior damage.

## Weapon Build

- **Strong V**
- Choose one: **Strong III**, **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Plateslayer**, **Wingslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one: **Plateslayer**, **Wingslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Warrior+**, Crit+

`C5` is their strongest combo. The differences between `C3` and `C6` are mostly up to personal preference, so choose your favorite. I personally run **Strong VI** due to its synergy with **Rainstorm**. You can choose two slayers, or just one + **Topsy-Turvy**. Corrin is not the best magical sword unit, but there aren’t many that can do it in the first place (Lianna and Celica being the other main ones). For your 5k skill it’s pretty standard fare: **Pair Up+** is the optimal choice, while Warrior and **Critical+** are good budget options.

| Live To Serve  | Lianna      |   X   |   X   |

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- More than anyone else in the cast, Corrin must have Astra. **If you plan on using them frequently, this should be the top priority when giving Astra to units.** Without Astra, their moveset feels clunky and slow, and Astra tightens up their animations so much.
- At maximum Luck, Corrin’s Luna will reduce foes’ Def/Res by roughly 46%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Luck +20 (Celica), Str +10 (Lissa), Mag +10 (Leo), Skill +10 (Takumi), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Live to Serve (Lianna)

- Armored Blow, as usual, is great on a player controlled unit. Pass is nice too, but not as needed.
- At maximum Luck, Corrin’s Aegis and Pavise will reduce damage taken vs the relevant weapons by roughly 34%.
- With Luck +20, Corrin’s Luna increases to roughly 50% Def/Res reduction, and their Aegis/Pavise damage reduction increases to roughly 40%.
- Str +10 and Mag +10 are your flat damage boosters, and Skill +10 is there should you decide to run **Critical+**.
- Live to Serve allows Corrin to sustain themselves while healing allies.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are good options for when you plan on frequently pair swapping.

#### Support Skills

Luck +20 (Celica), Str +10 (Lissa), Mag +10 (Leo), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Live to Serve (Lianna)
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are great if you plan on using Corrin as a pair up buddy, while Live to Serve, Aegis, and Pavise are better if you plan on using them to battle enemies across the map.
- Otherwise, see above.

## Conclusion

I think every single character in this game is a viable choice and worth the time if you find them fun. With that said, Corrin is… not as good as a lot of other units, unfortunately. The reason being that they just fail to stand out in any way, and their moveset is rather janky — as I said above, they NEED Astra to function on the level of other characters. On top of this, they are the only sword unit that has a weakness to **Dracoslayer**, and it is unfortunately one of the only two Weaknesseses that the enemy will actually exploit (the other being Winglsayer). It’s relatively minor, but it’s an extra consideration you have to make for a sword unit that you don’t have to make for literally any other, and Corrin doesn’t have anything in particular over the others to make up for it. To wrap it up, I’ll say this: If you like Corrin as a character, or think their moveset is cool looking (I certainly think it’s cool), feel free to invest in them. With Astra, they’re perfectly usable so long as you keep an eye out for Chrom, Lucina, and Marth. If you don’t have any particular attachment to Corrin, feel free to pass on them. Or, alternatively, use them as a pair up buddy for Tiki, who really appreciates the Str/Mag/Skill boosts and the Dual Strike slayer-skill one-shots that they give her.
