Hi everyone! Today’s guide will be on the scale-tipping tactician, Robin.

## Basic Info

| Mag  |   169 |
| Skl  |   142 |

Robin has a bit of an interesting statline. Their Luck, Defense, and Speed are pretty pitiful, but their Resistance, Magic, and Skill are fantastic. Their Strength is also pretty decent, making them the only viable **Topsy-Turvy** mage. His high Skill works incredibly well with his `C1` as well, but more on that later.

#### Staff

Never

#### Unique Weapon

None

#### Unique Skill

Solidarity: Increases Vanguard’s damage when paired up as a Support unit

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Mag/Res/Luck (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

**`C1` (Uncharged-49% charge):** Robin conjures a small amount of purple energy around them, dealing a very, very small amount of damage. This attack is literally useless.

**`C1` (50%-99%):** Robin shoots a ball of energy forward, damaging and exposing the stun gauge of every enemy hit. This move is decent enough if you can’t get a max charge for whatever reason (like 1v1ing an officer with no trash around). However, you really want to fully charge `C1` if at all possible.

**`C1` (100%):** Robin conjures a large pillar of light and fires an energy wave through it which then travels over a long distance. This attack exposes a yellow stun gauge on all enemies hit. This combo is one of the best `C1`s in the entire game. It charges very fast due to all of Robin’s attacks being AoE. It is an exceptional crowd clearer. And, most importantly, it gives Robin the ability to destroy any officer that they come across.

**`C2`:** Robin calls down fire in a small area which then explodes, launching enemies hit. It’s an ok launcher, but I’ve never really found it necessary.

**`C3`:** Robin calls in some wind around them, and fires a wide arc of wind forward a moderate distance. This combo doesn’t do a whole lot of damage, but it is pretty great at clearing trash to charge your `C1`.

**`C4`:** Robin conjures a ball of lightning in front of them, and after a few seconds shoots a thin bolt of lightning forward. This combo is… ok. It’s a little too narrow to be a better crowd clearer than `C3`, and the damage isn’t quite high enough to do a lot to officers, like `C5` and `C6`. It’s not a bad combo by any means, but it struggles to stand out compared to their other combos.

**`C5`:** Robin conjures a dome of dark energy that bounces enemies around inside it, and then explodes. This is the best officer killer in Robin’s kit, as their basic string before this launches enemies, allowing `C5` to continue the juggle.

**`C6`:** Robin calls down rays of light in the surrounding area before finishing with a giant light ray in front of them. This is a great combo for when you can’t choose between clearing crowds or killing officers- just use `C6` and do both. High damage in a high area, can’t ask for a whole lot more than that.

## Weapon Build

- **Strong I**
- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**
- Choose one: **Topsy-Turvy**, **Awaken Gift**, **Strong III**, **Strong IV**

You’re pretty much just loading up on Strong skills. I, V, and VI are your strongest, and of course **Rainstorm** is there too. Robin makes a great Pair Up buddy, but they’re also a crit machine, so take whichever you prefer. Robin is the best option for a **Topsy-Turvy** tome (which I think will only be reinforced by the DLC). However, their Magic is significantly higher than their Strength, so if you want to stick with a magic based build take whichever you like more between **Strong III** and IV. **Awaken Gift** is also an option since Robin cannot build the gauge naturally.

## Boost Skills

| Skill          | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| Astra          | Ryoma       | **M** | **M** |
| Luna           | Chrom       | **M** | **M** |
| Trample        | Camilla     | **M** | **M** |
| Armored Blow   | Tiki        |   O   |   –   |
| Pass           | Lyn         |   O   |   –   |
| Mag +10        | Leo         |   O   |   O   |
| Str + 10       | Lissa       |   O   |   O   |
| Skill +10      | Takumi      |   O   |   –   |
| Solidarity     | Robin       |   O   |   O   |
| Dracoshield    | Corrin      |   O   |   O   |
| Luck +20       | Celica      |   O   |   O   |
| Def +10        | Hinoka      |   O   |   O   |

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Trample (Camilla), Luna (Chrom)

- Everyone benefits from taking Astra, but Robin benefits more than most, as their basic string is rather slow.
- At maximum Luck, Robin gets 33% Def/Res reduction on hit from Luna. Not too substantial, but easily boosted by Luck +20.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Mag +10 (Leo), Str +10 (Lissa), Skill +10 (Takumi), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Luck +20 (Celica), Def +10 (Hinoka), Potent Potion (Rowan)

- Armored Blow is a great skill on any player controlled unit, and Pass is alright too.
- Luck +20 helps Robin use Luna better, increasing the Def/Res reduction to 48% on hit.
- Mag +10 and Str +10 are the flat damage boosters of choice- choose whichever matches your weapon.
- Skill +10 is a solid choice if you opted for Crit+
- Def +10 is the best way to shore up their poor Defense.
- If you plan on having Robin in a pair up, consider Solidarity or Dracoshield. They make a great partner as their dual strike exposes a while stun gauge on every enemy type.
- Potent Potion lets them support their team with backup heals.

#### Support Skills

Luck +20 (Celica), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Potent Potion (Rowan), Mag +10 (Leo), Str +10 (Lissa), Def +10 (Hinoka)

- Since they won’t be controlled at all, Solidarity, Dracoshield, and Potent Potion are a higher priority here.
- Luck +20 is still incredibly helpful to boost the Luna damage.
- If you plan on having Robin mostly attack enemies in the field, Str/Mag +10 and Def +10 are worth taking. They’re relatively pointless in the back of a pair up, though.

## Conclusion

In my opinion, Robin is one of the most powerful characters in the game once they get their hands on Astra. All they truly lack is a mount, and their Defense and Luck are admittedly shaky. Their matchups are neutral at worst, and whether as a Vanguard, Support, or AI unit they do pretty much everything you need them to do. I seriously cannot overstate how powerful their fully charged `C1` is, especially with how quickly it charges. Give Robin a flying buddy to help them get around and they do work.
