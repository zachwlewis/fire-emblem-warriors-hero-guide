Hi everyone! Today’s guide will be on the trio of Pegasus Knights, Cordelia, Hinoka, and Caeda.

## Basic Info

### Cordelia

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |

| HP   |   818 |
| Str  |    89 |
| Mag  |    89 |

Of the three Pegasus Knights, what makes Cordelia stand out is her Magic. She is equally viable as both a physical and magical unit, but using **Topsy-Turvy** is the easiest way to carve out a niche for her. Her heals, by extension, are the most potent of the three. As for the rest of her statline, it’s fairly well-balanced, with her skill being the high point and her Luck on the lower side. She sports massive Resistance as well, though this is a trait shared by her sisters-in-arms.

### Hinoka

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

Despite having the lowest Resistance of the three, Hinoka’s claim to fame is her bulk, being overall the highest of the three Pegasi. She also has he highest Strength of the three. This makes her the best all-around brawler of the three and the best suited to handle physical threats.

Caeda is the most "traditional" Pegasus Knight in the game, with absurdly high Speed, Luck, and Resistance, but with low Strength and Defense. Thankfully, given her high Speed, she can carve out a niche for herself with an Awakening focused build. Her high Luck lets hher use Luna to amazing effect as well.

## Moveset

**`Y1` (Dashing):** The unit quickly swoops forward. This attack replaces regular `Y1` and is quite good as a gapcloser.

**`C1` (Standard):** After charging the meter by attacking, the unit carries nearby foes into the air, where she can stay until the meter depletes. While in the air, her regular combo is replaced by a three hit combo, and her strong attack is replaced by a dive bomb the can end the effect early. This might be a bit of a controversial opinion, but while this combo definitely has its uses, other combos juggle just as easily without awkwardly stopping to fly into the air.

**`C1` (Dashing):** The unit flies forward and dive bombs nearby enemies. It’s a solid hit-and-run crowd clearer. You can also spam this rather easily, which looks a bit silly but is fairly effective.

**`C2`:** The unit Pegasus does a backflip, launching enemies in front. It’s a launcher, which is neat, bt since the Pegasi have so many other juggling options it’s not really needed.

**`C3`:** The unit spins in place, damaging nearby enemies. A nice, simple, short-range crowd clearer. It gets the job done without having too much forward momentum.

**`C4`:** The unit throws three javelins of light, with the third doing more damage than the first two. Each javelin exposes the stun gauge on enemies without WTA over the unit. The unit can rotate in place while tossing the javelins. This combo is pretty nice, allowing you to clear wide areas while exposing officer stun gauges. Each javelin knocks launcahble opponents up, which can then lead into a juggle to break the stun gauge that she just exposed.

**`C5`:** The unit charges forward, stabbing enemies in front with her spear, and then does a wide slash in front. This is an incredible stun gauge breaker- there isn’t much in the game that won’t get their gauge broken by a `C4`->`C5` combo. The area clear is a bit lacking though, so don’t bother using it to clear crowds.

**`C6`:** The unit quickly dashes in a triangle formation, gathering up enemies in front. She then flies back and spins her lance, and charges into the triangle, doing damage to enemies in a large area. While spinning her lance, the unit is invulnerable. This is a pretty great crowd clearer, and also doubles as a stun gauge breaker.

## Weapon Builds

### Cordelia

- **Strong IV**
- **Strong V**
- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong III**, **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**, **Warrior+**

`C4` and `C5` are the best Pegasus Knight combos IMO. Beyond that, you can choose your favorite crowd clearer between `C1`, `C3`, and `C6`. **Topsy-Turvy** is Cordelia’s main niche, so definitely run that. **Pair Up+** is far and away the best 5k skill for a Pegasus, since they often will be ferrying allies around the map, but given her high Skill the other 2 deserve mention.

### Hinoka

- **Strong IV**
- **Strong V**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Antitriangle**, **Plateslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: **Antitriangle**, **Plateslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- **Pair Up+**

Hinoka has 6 weapon slot syndrome. **Strong IV**, V, and **Rainstorm** are pretty necessary. **Pair Up+** is also too good to pass up on. Having a legendary weapon, she really wants to run two slayers, but given her statline she also wants to duke it out with axe wielders with **Antitriangle**. The choice you make is ultimately up to you. Personally, I went with two slayers- you can easily take **Dracoslayer** and **Plateslayer** for effective damage against certain axe using enemies.

### Caeda

- **Strong IV**
- **Strong V**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**
- **Awaken Gift**
- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong III**, **Strong VI**, **Antitriangle**

We’re going full Awakening with Caeda. As such, you can consider Crit+ over **Pair Up+** as she will have yellow gauges most of the time, though **Pair Up+** is a much more consistent booster. **Awaken Gift** is necessary for this build, extending her already high Awakening uptime. For your last slot, choose your favorite crowd clearer, or take **Antitriangle** if you opted for double slayers on Hinoka.

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- The big three DPS boosters.
- At maximum Luck, Luna's def/res reduction is 39%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Mag +10 (Leo), Dracoshield (Corrin), Solidarity (Robin), Pavise (Frederick), Aegis (Xander), Live to Serve (Lianna), Luck +20 (Celica)

- Armored Blow and Pass are very valuable on units with large hitboxes, and Cordelia is no exception.
- At maximum Luck, Aegis and Pavise will reduce damage by roughly 25%.
- Luck +20 increases Luna's Def/Res reduction to 44%, and Aegis/Pavise's damage reduction by 32%.
- Mag +10 is a flat damage boost that helps patch her so-so offense.
- Even as a player controlled unit, Cordelia will often be supporting an ally, so Solidarity and Dracoshield are great options.
- Live to Serve gives Cordelia a little bit of self-sustain.

#### Support Skills

Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Mag +10 (Leo), Luck +20 (Celica), Live to Serve (Lianna), Sol (Cordelia), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick)

- Sol can be run over Live to Serve if you want. It’s less consistent but way cheaper specifically on Cordelia.
- All other skills were covered sufficiently above.

### Caeda

| Skill          | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Astra**      | **Ryoma**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Luna**       | **Chrom**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Trample**    | **Camilla** | **X** | **X** |
| Awakening      | Lucina      |   X   |       |
| Armored Blow   | Tiki        |   X   |       |
| Str +10        | Lissa       |   X   |   X   |
| Dracoshield    | Corrin      |   X   |   X   |
| Solidarity     | Robin       |   X   |   X   |
| Pavise         | Frederick   |   X   |       |

| Live To Serve  | Lianna      |   X   |   X   |
| Luck +20       | Celica      |   X   |   X   |
{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- The big three DPS boosters.
- At max Luck, Luna's def/res reduction is 50%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Awakening (Lucina), Armored Blow (Tiki), Str +10 (Lissa), Dracoshield (Corrin), Solidarity (Robin), Pavise (Frederick), Aegis (Xander), Live to Serve (Lianna), Luck +20 (Celica)

- Awakening is super helpful for an Awakening build, boosting the damage dealt. Speed +10 adds only a second to her Awakening duration, so it's not worth the slot.
- Aegis and Pavise will reduce damage taken by 40% at maximum Luck.
- Luck +20 increases Luna's def/res reduction to roughly 55%, and Aegis/Pavise's damage reduction to roughly 47%.
- Note that while Awakening mode is active, the unit innately has Armored Blow and Pass regardless of if they are equipped. You might want Armored Blow anyway, but it’s significantly less necessary for an Awakening build.
- All other skills covered sufficiently in above sections.

#### Support Skills

Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Str +10 (Lissa), Luck +20 (Celica), Live to Serve (Lianna)

- I included these for consistency’s sake, but **Caeda should never really be a green square unit.** Her unique strengths are only usable with player control. If you want an AI controlled Pegasus Knight, go with one of the other two.

## Conclusion

Being the only Pre-DLC lancers, they are invaluable assets to any team. Despite their large hitboxes, they are surprisingly lightweight and fast, and make up for their generally low damage by being the juggling queens of FE Warriors. Their ability to dart in and out of fights is unrivaled, and they are excellent team supporters offering both heals and high speed transport. Just don’t fight archers with them.
