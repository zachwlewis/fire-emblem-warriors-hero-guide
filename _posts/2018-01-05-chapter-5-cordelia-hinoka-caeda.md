Hi everyone! Today’s guide will be on the trio of Pegasus Knights, Cordelia, Hinoka, and Caeda.

## Basic Info

### Cordelia

#### Stats at Level 150 Promoted

| Stat | Value |

Of the three Pegasus Knights, what makes Cordelia stand out is her Magic. She is equally viable as both a physical and magical unit, but using **Topsy-Turvy** is the easiest way to carve out a niche for her. Her heals, by extension, are the most potent of the three. As for the rest of her statline, it’s fairly well-balanced, with her skill being the high point and her Luck on the lower side. She sports massive Resistance as well, though this is a trait shared by her sisters-in-arms.

### Hinoka

#### Stats at Level 150 Promoted

| Stat | Value |

| Lck  |   123 |
| Def  |   115 |
| Res  |   171 |
{: .table .table-sm .stats}

Despite having the lowest Resistance of the three, Hinoka’s claim to fame is her bulk, being overall the highest of the three Pegasi. She also has he highest Strength of the three. This makes her the best all-around brawler of the three and the best suited to handle physical threats.

Caeda is the most "traditional" Pegasus Knight in the game, with absurdly high Speed, Luck, and Resistance, but with low Strength and Defense. Thankfully, given her high Speed, she can carve out a niche for herself with an Awakening focused build. Her high Luck lets hher use Luna to amazing effect as well.

## Moveset

**`Y1` (Dashing):** The unit quickly swoops forward. This attack replaces regular `Y1` and is quite good as a gapcloser.

**`C1` (Standard):** After charging the meter by attacking, the unit carries nearby foes into the air, where she can stay until the meter depletes. While in the air, her regular combo is replaced by a three hit combo, and her strong attack is replaced by a dive bomb the can end the effect early. This might be a bit of a controversial opinion, but while this combo definitely has its uses, other combos juggle just as easily without awkwardly stopping to fly into the air.

**`C1` (Dashing):** The unit flies forward and dive bombs nearby enemies. It’s a solid hit-and-run crowd clearer. You can also spam this rather easily, which looks a bit silly but is fairly effective.

**`C2`:** The unit Pegasus does a backflip, launching enemies in front. It’s a launcher, which is neat, bt since the Pegasi have so many other juggling options it’s not really needed.

**`C3`:** The unit spins in place, damaging nearby enemies. A nice, simple, short-range crowd clearer. It gets the job done without having too much forward momentum.

**`C4`:** The unit throws three javelins of light, with the third doing more damage than the first two. Each javelin exposes the stun gauge on enemies without WTA over the unit. The unit can rotate in place while tossing the javelins. This combo is pretty nice, allowing you to clear wide areas while exposing officer stun gauges. Each javelin knocks launcahble opponents up, which can then lead into a juggle to break the stun gauge that she just exposed.

**`C5`:** The unit charges forward, stabbing enemies in front with her spear, and then does a wide slash in front. This is an incredible stun gauge breaker- there isn’t much in the game that won’t get their gauge broken by a `C4`->`C5` combo. The area clear is a bit lacking though, so don’t bother using it to clear crowds.

**`C6`:** The unit quickly dashes in a triangle formation, gathering up enemies in front. She then flies back and spins her lance, and charges into the triangle, doing damage to enemies in a large area. While spinning her lance, the unit is invulnerable. This is a pretty great crowd clearer, and also doubles as a stun gauge breaker.

## Weapon Builds

### Cordelia

- **Strong IV**
- **Strong V**
- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong III**, **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**, **Warrior+**

`C4` and `C5` are the best Pegasus Knight combos IMO. Beyond that, you can choose your favorite crowd clearer between `C1`, `C3`, and `C6`. **Topsy-Turvy** is Cordelia’s main niche, so definitely run that. **Pair Up+** is far and away the best 5k skill for a Pegasus, since they often will be ferrying allies around the map, but given her high Skill the other 2 deserve mention.

### Hinoka

- **Strong IV**
- **Strong V**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Antitriangle**, **Plateslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: **Antitriangle**, **Plateslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- **Pair Up+**

Hinoka has 6 weapon slot syndrome. **Strong IV**, V, and **Rainstorm** are pretty necessary. **Pair Up+** is also too good to pass up on. Having a legendary weapon, she really wants to run two slayers, but given her statline she also wants to duke it out with axe wielders with **Antitriangle**. The choice you make is ultimately up to you. Personally, I went with two slayers- you can easily take **Dracoslayer** and **Plateslayer** for effective damage against certain axe using enemies.

### Caeda

#### Vanilla

- **Strong IV**
- **Strong V**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**
- **Awaken Gift**
- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong III**, **Strong VI**, **Antitriangle**

We’re going full Awakening with Caeda. As such, you can consider Crit+ over **Pair Up+** as she will have yellow gauges most of the time, though **Pair Up+** is a much more consistent booster. **Awaken Gift** is necessary for this build, extending her already high Awakening uptime. For your last slot, choose your favorite crowd clearer, or take **Antitriangle** if you opted for double slayers on Hinoka.

#### DLC

##### Wing Spear

- **Armor Strike**
- Choose one: Axebreaker, Lancebreaker, **Stonebreaker**
- Choose one: Strong I, **Strong IV**, Strong V, or Critical Focus
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Warrior+, Critical+
- Choose one: **Amped**, Bolster, Antitriangle, or Critical Focus
- Choose one: **Wingslayer** or Dracoslayer
- _Rampager_
- _Divine Favor_

Caeda's Wing Spear is unique, even for a signature weapon — it's the only weapon in the game with access to the aptly named Rampager skill. Rampager is Mountslayer and Plateslayer combined, which means she gets two slayers for the price of one. Adding a third slayer of your choice gives Caeda winning matchups against most of the cast. Armor Strike is always nice to have. If you have the Fates DLC, choose a breaker. Axebreaker and Lancebreaker are good all around choices, and while Stonebreaker is usually bad, it can actually help a Wingslayer Caeda against Manaketes. If you don't have the Fates DLC, take a second Strong skill. The Pegasus Knight moveset has quite a few good combos, so choose your favorite. Strong I helps your crowd clear, Strong V helps vs officers, and Strong IV helps with both, but doesn't do either as well. Next, a 5k skill: Pair Up+ is the best as usual, but Warrior and Critical are solid as well. Next, Amped is a fantastic skill that boosts all of Caeda's stats by 20%. This includes her absolutely massive Luck stat. You could alternatively go with Bolster, which increases the potency of your 5k and Strong skills, Antitriangle, to give her a more defined niche (though units strong against axes are a dime a dozen in this game), or Critical Focus, which is nice but not stricly necessary as Caeda has no trouble breaking stun gauges.

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory skills

**Astra (Ryoma)**, **Luna (Chrom)**, **Luck+20 (Celica)**

- The three most consistent damage boosters.
- At Level 150, Luna ignores ~41% of foes' Defense on hit. With Luck +20, this is boosted to ~46%, and adding Amped with Luck +20 boosts it to ~54%.

#### Vanguard Skills

**Armored Blow (Tiki)**, Pass (Lyn), **Lethality (Niles)**, **Galeforce (Olivia)**, Awakening (Lucina), Lone Wolf (Navarre), Iote's Shield (Minerva), Resonating Power (Owain), Trample (Camilla), Solidarity (Robin), Vengeance (Tharja)

- Armored Blow helps Caeda get in on ranged opponents and generally helps to protect her from having her armor broken. Pass fills a similar niche, but is overall less useful.
- At level 150, Lethality has a ~82% activation rate. With Luck +20, it goes up to ~92%, and adding Amped on top of that puts you well over 100%.
- Galeforce lets Caeda enter Awakening mode quickly and stay there longer.
- Awakening is a nice damage boost while in Awakening mode, and synergizes very well with Galeforce.
- Lone Wolf is a huge damage boost, but runs somewhat counter to Caeda's role as a flier.
- Iote's Shield lets Caeda increase her good matchups even further by allowing her to engage archers.
- Despite the large difference between Caeda's Strength and Magic, Resonating Power gives Caeda a slightly larger buff than Trample does, which can be nice.
- Trample is wholly outclassed by Resonating Power, but can be an option for those lacking the Awakening DLC.
- Solidarity gives a nice 25% boost when Caeda is the support, which synergizes well with her role as a flier.
- Vengeance is a very high risk, high reward skill. The damage boost it gives is absolutely massive, but be sure to have all of your prayer crests purchased, and ideally some potions to drink. 

#### Support Skills

**Lone Wolf (Navarre)**, Iote's Shield (Minerva), **Resonating Power (Owain)**, Trample (Camilla), **Solidarity (Robin)**, Live to Serve (Lianna)

- If Caeda is going to be fighting enemies in the field, Lone Wolf is a great skill for her to have.
- Iote's Shield lets Caeda increase her good matchups even further by allowing her to engage archers.
- Despite the large difference between Caeda's Strength and Magic, Resonating Power gives Caeda a slightly larger buff than Trample does, which can be nice.
- Trample is wholly outclassed by Resonating Power, but can be an option for those lacking the Awakening DLC.
- Solidarity gives a nice 25% boost when Caeda is the support, which synergizes well with her role as a flier.
- Live to Serve can help Caeda sustain herself while in the field.

## Conclusion

Being the only Pre-DLC lancers, they are invaluable assets to any team. Despite their large hitboxes, they are surprisingly lightweight and fast, and make up for their generally low damage by being the juggling queens of FE Warriors. Their ability to dart in and out of fights is unrivaled, and they are excellent team supporters offering both heals and high speed transport. Just don’t fight archers with them.
