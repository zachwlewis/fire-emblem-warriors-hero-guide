Oboro's standout feature is her physical tankiness, sporting impressive HP and Defense alongside slightly below average Resistance. Her relevant offenses are solid as well, with high Skill and solid Luck and Strength. In an ideal world, she would swap her Luck with her Speed, but she's still a force to be reckoned with regardless.

#### Unique Weapon

Oboro's Spear (no 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th)

#### Unique Skill

Counter: When blocking powerful attacks, emits a shockwave that exposes the stun gauge on nearby enemies. Type of stun gauge is determined by the weapon tringle as usual (with no stun gauge appearing if Oboro has WTD against her foe).

#### Staff

Never

#### Weaknesses

None

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Def/Skill/Luck (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

**`C1`:** Oboro spins her lance above her head, causing a tornado to form around her. This is by far Oboro's best crowd clearer. Just run around using `C1` to clear hordes of fodder/charge special meter. The damage it does is pitiful on anything other than trash though, so be mindful of that.

**`C2`:** Oboro swipes upward and leaps backward, launching enemies hit.

**`C3`:** Oboro spins forward and slashes horizontally three times. This is another good crowd clearer, but ultimately less spammy than `C1`.

**`C4`:** Oboro slashes in an `X` formation, then slashes vertically, then finishes with a forward jab. Enemies struck by the final jab have their stun gauges exposed unless Oboro has WTD against her foe. This combo, while slightly unwieldy at times, is essential to Oboro's playstyle as an officer killer.

**`C5`:** Oboro twirls her lance on her right side, then overhead, then jumps while twirling it on her left side, and finishes with a downward slash. This is a solid orange stun gauge breaker.

**`C6`:** Oboro leaps into the air and rapidly stabs the area below her before finishing with a diagonal slash. Unlike most `C6`s, which do a large amount of damage over a large area, Oboro's `C6` does a huge amount of damage in a very concentrated area. This combo is ideal for breaking white stun gauges- she can easily smash even full health white stun gauges if `C6` fully connects.

## Weapon Build

_My choices in italics._

_Oboro's Spear_

- _**Strong VI**_
- Choose one: _**Plateslayer**_, **Dracoslayer**, **Wingslayer**, **Mountslayer**
- Choose one: **Plateslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, _**Wingslayer**_, **Mountslayer**
- Choose one: _**Axebreaker**_, **Lancebreaker**, **Bowbreaker**
- Choose one: _**Pair Up+**_, **Warrior+**, **Critical+**
- Choose one: _**Armor Strike**_, **Antitriangle**, **Rainstorm**, **Fury Builder**
- _**True Power**_

Oboro's `C6` is her highest damage combo by far, so boost that. Take two slayers depending on what you have/what coverage you need. Choose a breaker skill based on the slayers you took- **Axebreaker** allows Oboro to deal with infantry axe users, but if you choose to run Plate and **Dracoslayer** you might find Lance or **Bowbreaker** to be more useful. **Pair Up+** is the most powerful of the 5k skills, but **Warrior+** and **Critical+** are decent budget options. Finally, Oboro is pretty much made for **Armor Strike**, but if you prefer a low risk style, **Antitriangle**, **Rainstorm**, or **Fury Builder** are acceptable substitutes.

*my choices in italics*

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla), Luck +20 (Celica)

- The big 4. The only note to make here is that Luck +20 doesn't do much for you unless Luna is already equipped.

#### Vanguard Skills

*Armored Blow (Tiki)*, Pass (Lyn), *Lethality (Niles)*, Counter (Oboro), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- Armored Blow and Pass help to negate the risks of **Armor Strike** (and are just generally very useful skills). Personally, I would at least run Armored Blow should you choose to run **Armor Strike**.
- Lethality has a lot of potential for boosting damage on crit, which couples well with **Armor Strike** and Luck +20.
- Counter allows another option to open up stun gauges, which can be particularly useful against annoying enemies like Archers or Mages. Additionally, Oboro gets this skill for cheap, so it's an attractive budget option.
- Dracoshield and especially Solidarity are worth considering if you plan on frequent pair-swapping.

#### Support Skills

*Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)*, Potent Potion (Rowan)

- Oboro is more likely to be a pair up buddy as a green square unit, so Solidarity and Dracoshield are more valuable for her.
- Alternatively, you could choose to run Potent Potion to allow her to be a backup healer.

## Conclusion

Oboro is unique among the spear users for being the best officer killer by far. Oboro can throw down with pretty much any officer and come out on top. Her crowd clear is also fantastic, with her `C1` offering quick, spammable clears. Her one major weakness is magic users, so be careful against those enemy types. Overall, Oboro is a great choice, especially on maps that feature incredibly tanky officers that can be difficult to grind down.
