Move over Anna, there's a new queen of Luck in town. With a whopping 176, Olivia has the best Luck in the game, and good thing too, because her other offensive stats are atrocious. She has pretty awful bulk as well, but her criticals are very potent, and she has naturally high Awakening uptime.

#### Staff

Never

#### Unique Weapon

Olivia's Blade (no 7th slot, True Power/Divine Favor in 8th)

#### Unique Skill

Galeforce: After defeating an officer, grants a small amount of Warrior/Awakening meter.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Skill/Speed/Luck (+5 if A/A+, +3 otherwise)

## Moveset

`C1`: Olivia dances, granting all allies within a large radius Awakening and Warrior meter. The amount of meter granted increases based on how full Olivia’s special bar is. At maximum charge, Olivia gives her allies one bar of Warrior meter and 1/3 of a bar of Awakening meter. The bar charges by attacking, and using specials will fill this bar, unlike other similarly charged `C1`s. It's functionally identical to Azura's, so use it in the same ways: to feed Tiki, or to easily generate Dual Specials.

`C2`: Olivia quickly slashes upward, launching enemies hit. Olivia has so many other tools that naturally juggle that you won't really need this one.

`C3`: Olivia twirls repeatedly while moving forward a short distance. A nice, short range, spammy crowd clearer.

`C4`: Olivia throws three blades forward that spin vertically like buzzsaws, which then drag enemies toward her. Olivia then leaps forward to meet them and slashes, revealing the stun gauge of any foe that does not have WTA over her. This is a pretty cool looking combo and the utility is quite nice too.

`C5`: Olivia sends out two pink tornados that gather up enemies in front of her. She then leaps forward with a diagonal slash. This is a wonderful skill to break stun gauges with.

`C6`: Olivia twirls repeatedly as in `C3`, but this time surrounded by six horizontal spinning blades in a large circle around her. She then finishes it off with a horizontal slash. Olivia can somewhat control her movement while spinning. This is a great high damage all-purpose combo, offering crowd clear and stun gauge smashing in spades.

## Weapon Build

My choices in **bold**, locked skills in _italics_.
{:.alert .alert-info}

- Choose one: Fury Builder or Armor Strike
- **Amped**
- Choose one: **Swordbreaker**, Lancebreaker, Critical Focus
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Critical+, Warrior+
- Choose one: **Wingslayer**, Plateslayer, Mountslayer
- Choose one: Wingslayer, **Plateslayer**, Mountslayer
- _Divine Favor_

Fury builder can help Olivia build up some damage as the game goes on while Armor Strike helps clean up any opponents that don't instantly die to Lethality. Amped boosts all of Olivia's stats by 20%, which hugely increases her DPS considering how much Luck she already has. It's also nice for extending her already long Awakening duration. Next, choose a breaker. You can also take Critical Focus, though Olivia has no trouble at all breaking stun gauges without it. Pair Up+ is, as usual, the strongest of the 5k skills, with Critical and Warrior being solid runner-ups. Finally, round out the build with two slayers of your choice.

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

**Astra (Ryoma)**, **Luna (Chrom)**

- At max Luck, Luna will ignore 44% of foes' Def on hit. With Luck +20, this is increased to 49%. With Amped, this is increased to ~53%. With both Luck +20 and Amped, this is increased to ~58%. 

#### Vanguard Skills

**Luck +20 (Celica)**, Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), **Lethality (Niles)**, **Galeforce (Olivia)**, **Awakening (Lucina)**, Lone Wolf (Navarre), Resonating Power (Owain), Solidarity (Robin), Vengeance (Tharja)

- Luck +20 is an amazing skill, but it's not stricly necessary given that Amped provides a much larger Luck bonus. More Luck is always better, but since she has so much to begin with, you can consider leaving this one out.
- Armored Blow, and to a lesser degree, Pass, help to mitigate the risk carried by Armor Strike, and Armored Blow in particular is a must have on a non-Awakening focused build.
- Lethality is the source of the vast majority of Olivia's damage. At maximum Luck, she has an 88% chance to proc. With Luck +20, that's increased to 98%. Adding Amped to the equation, with or without Luck +20, puts Olivia over 100% to proc.
- Galeforce allows Olivia to get into Awakening mode and stay there for quite some time. She won't be as good at it as Tiki, but she'll come damn close.
- Awakening boosts Olivia's damage while in Awakening mode, and synergizes very well with Galeforce.
- Lone Wolf is a significant damage booster for those who don't like playing with Pair Up.
- At max Str/Mag, Olivia gets a 19.8% damage boost from Resonating Power. 
- Solidarity gives the Vanguard a 25% damage boost, which is very nice if you prefer using Olivia for dancer utility.
- Vengeance is a high-risk, high-reward skill that carries a lot of potential for high damage. If you decide to use it, be sure to have your prayer crests built, and carry potions for emergencies.

#### Support Skills

**Luck +20 (Celica)**, **Lone Wolf (Navarre)**, Resonating Power (Owain), **Solidarity (Robin)**, **Potent Potion (Rowan)**

Please bear in mind that using Olivia as an AI controlled unit causes her to lose out on her main strengths: Dance utility and high-proc rate Lethality criticals.
{:.alert .alert-warning}

- Lone Wolf is excellent for sending Olivia out on her own if needed.
- Resonating Power is a weaker option, but still worth considering.
- Solidarity is great for supporting allies in a Pair Up.
- Potent Potion allows Olivia to heal as well as dance.

## Conclusion

Olivia is all crits, all the time. With a monstrous Luck stat, she makes up for poor offenses by flat out ignoring the enemies and decimating them with guaranteed Lethality procs. Her crowd clearing is great, with her moveset offering a lot of large area damage. Her skill allows herself (and any others who may inherit it) to be mini Tikis, rampaging across the battlefield with increased Awakening duration. With her reliance on criticals, she herself makes fantastic use of an Awakening focused build. Finally, she caps it off by having fantastic utility as one of the only refreshers in Warriors, which helps to enable her allies' success. Overall, Olivia is a pretty great unit.
