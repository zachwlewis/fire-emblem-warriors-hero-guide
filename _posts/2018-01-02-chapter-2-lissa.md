title: Chapter 2 — Lissa
layout: chapter

Hello and welcome to another FE Warriors character guide. This time, I’ll be covering everyone’s favorite nun with an axe, Lissa.

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   867 |
| Str  |    87 |
| Mag  |   129 |
| Skl  |    99 |
| Spe  |    96 |
| Lck  |   121 |
| Def  |    51 |
| Res  |   149 |

Right off the bat we can see that Lissa, despite her insistence to the contrary, is incredibly delicate. 51 defense at level 130 is bad, no two ways about it. However, she sports impressive Mag, meaning that with **Topsy-Turvy**, she will melt many of the low-resistance physical attackers that are otherwise strong against her.  Similarly, she has a gigantic Resistance stat, allowing her to win slugfests with magical enemies even if she is using **Topsy-Turvy**. Aside from her luck, the rest of her stats are pretty middling.

#### Staff

Always

#### Unique Weapon

None

#### Unique Skill

Str +10: increases Strength by 10.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Mag/Res/Luck (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

**`C1`:** Lissa raises her axe above her head and gets pumped for battle. This combo does no damage on its own, but it boosts her Str, Mag, Def, and Res by 20% for about 30 seconds. Make sure you have this active when fighting tougher enemies. The buff is not affected by **Strong I**.

**`C2`:** Lissa does an upwards slash at close range, launching enemies hit. This is your run-of-the-mill launcher. Use it to set up juggles on neutral or bad matchups to break white stun gauges. It’s relatively unnecessary for yellow gauges.

**`C3`:** Lissa spins in a circle a few times, grabbing the first enemy hit. When the attack ends, she falls over for a few seconds. You can cancel this by dodging or pair swapping just at the right time, but that’s a lot of effort for a relatively mediocre combo.

**`C4`:** Lissa slashes with her axe and throws it a short distance in front of her. After a brief delay, the axe explodes with lightning, damaging nearby enemies and exposing stun gauges on any enemy that doesn’t have WTA over her. This is a pretty good combo, with decent area clear and utility. Use it to clear small areas of enemies or to set up a juggle.

**`C5`:** Lissa slams her axe into the ground, using the forward momentum to spin like a wheel, grabbing the first enemy hit and carrying them with her for the duration of the attack. This is in the running for one of the most fun moves in the entire game if only for the sheer absurdity of it. However, it’s also incredibly useful as it utterly devours officers and stun gauges.

**`C6`:** Lissa throws her axe like a boomerang around her, catches it, spins a few times, and slams it into the ground, causing an immense lightning explosion around her. This is a fantastic area clearer that basically combines her `C3` and `C4`, clearing both her immediate surroundings and a large area in front.

## Weapon Skills

- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose One: **Pair Up+**, **Warrior+**, **Critical+**
- Choose One: **Strong IV**, **Awaken Gift**

**Strong V** and VI are her most versatile combos, devouring officers and crowds alike. Her regular combo is pretty powerful on its own, and **Rainstorm** boosts it further. **Topsy-Turvy** allows her to take advantage of her massive Mag stat. After that, choose your favorite of **Pair Up+**, Crit+, or **Warrior+**. Personally, I recommend **Pair Up+** for her. Given her physical frailty, she will often be reliant on dual guards to not take too much damage, so you might as well boost her damage at the same time. For your final slot, choose between **Strong IV** or **Awaken Gift**. `C4` doesn’t have the same crowd clearing potential as `C6`, but it does expose stun gauges. **Awaken Gift** can be handy in a pinch.

As an aside, given that Lissa has by far the highest resistance of any pre-DLC axe user, you could choose to opt out of using **Topsy-Turvy** and go full mage-hunter. Camilla’s magic is solid enough to pull off a **Topsy-Turvy** set in that case. I personally recommend against doing that, given that she can brute force her way through mages even with a magical weapon. However, if you don’t like playing as Lissa, she can function very well with a physical weapon as an AI, quickly hunting down mages and otherwise supporting allies with heals or as a pair up partner.

| Dracoshield   | Corrin      |       |   X   |

#### Mandatory Skills

- Astra (Ryoma)
- Luna (Chrom)
- Trample (Camilla)

These skills need no introduction, being the three most reliable damage boosting skills in the game. They are good on everyone all the time. At maximum Luck, Luna will reduce foes' Def/Res by 45%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Defense +10 (Hinoka), Live to Serve (Lianna), Mag +10 (Leo), Luck +20 (Celica), Awakening (Lucina)

- **Armored Blow is pretty much a must for any player controlled unit**, but the AI doesn’t really care much about it. Beyond that, it’s up to you.
- Pass allows uninterrupted approaches on anyone, particularly mages, who Lissa will be fighting a lot of.
- At maximum Luck, Aegis and Pavise reduce damage taken vs the relevant weapons by 33%.
- With Luck +20, Luna's Def/Res reduction is increased to roughly 50%, and Aegis/Pavise's damage reduction is increased to roughly 40%.
- Def +10 is a consistent booster that reduces the damage she takes fairly significantly.
- Live to Serve is a nifty choice to stay topped off while supporting allies.
- Mag +10 is a general damage booster.
- Awakening is more of a niche choice, but consider this especially if you decide to roll with **Awaken Gift**.
- A player controlled Lissa might want a friend with Dracoshield as a support partner in order to shore up her poor defense.

#### Support Skills

Live to Serve (Lianna), Luck +20 (Celica) Mag +10 (Leo), Str +10 (Lissa), Defense +10 (Hinoka), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- Live to Serve is a fair bit more valuable on an AI controlled unit, since they will definitely take damage doing whatever they are doing and not demand that another healer gets sent over to wherever they are. Alternatively, you can run Sol to sustain while battling across the field.
- Choose Mag +10 if using **Topsy-Turvy**, and Str +10 if you are going for a mage hunter physical set. Def +10 is an option to boost up her poor Defense to a more serviceable level.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are worth running if you plan on having Lissa as a pair up buddy. This does limit her ability to heal, so be wary.

## Final Notes

That brings us to the end of the character guide for Lissa. She is personally one of my favorite characters to use, and I hope she is one of yours too!
