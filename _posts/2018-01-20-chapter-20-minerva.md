## Moveset

Minerva’s standard `C1` charges by attacking enemies. Her dashing `C1` is unaffected by the charge meter.
{:.alert .alert-info}

**`Y1` (Dash):** Minerva’s wyvern lands on the ground and slides forward, dealing a small amount of damage to enemies. This is a much better way to initiate a fight than stopping for a standard `Y1`.

**`C1` (Standard, 0-49% charge):** Minerva swipes horizontally with her axe. Pretty useless ‘combo.’

**`C1` (Standard, 50-99% charge):** Minerva swings her axe downward twice, with the first hit grabbing the first enemy hit. This is… not as good as the 100%, but an ok way to separate an officer from a crowd.

**`C1` (Standard, 100% charge):** Minerva quickly swings her axe and then slams it into the ground three times, with the third hit causing a small explosion. The first hit can grab. This is like a watered down version of her `C6`, however, it comes out much faster and is a good way to get some cheap damage on an officer.

**`C1` (Dash):** Minerva’s wyvern does a backflip and slams into the ground. Just like the Pegasus dashing `C1`, this is a great hit-and-run crowd clearer, and I’m fairly sure this hits a larger area than the Pegasus one. It’s also spammable, which is rather neat. You can basically spam this for most of a given map and that would be a successful strategy.

**`C2`:** Minerva’s wyvern does a backflip, launching nearby enemies. Minerva doesn’t have too many juggle starters (`Y4` is her other main one), so this is quite a valuable attack, having good synergy with `C6` in particular.

**`C3`:** Minerva’s wyvern spins forward twice, and Minerva follows up with two slashes that form an ‘X’ shape. A pretty nice crowd clearer that has a fair bit of forward momentum.

**`C4`:** Minerva spins her axe above her head to conjure a massive fireball, which she then flings forward, damaging enemies in a large area. This combo will reveal the stun gauge of any foe that doesn’t have WTA over her. This is my personal favorite crowd clearer, as it hits a massive area and has the added utility of exposing weak points. The downside is that it takes a long time to charge up, so it is best used with Armored Blow from relative safety.

**`C5`:** Minerva slashes horizontally twice before tossing her axe in the air, carrying up enemies hit. She then follows them up and uses her wyvern to launch a fireball at the airborne enemies. This combo absolutely shreds stun gauges, as the axe toss hits multiple times on their way up into the air. Note that the fireball toss on this combo is not an effective crowd clearer.

**`C6`:** Minerva swipes upward with her axe, grabbing an airborne enemy if there is one. She then repeatedly slams her axe into the ground, with the final slam causing a fiery explosion that damages nearby enemies. This combo is utterly brutal. Note that she can potentially grab trash with this, and I’m fairly certain that her victim must be airborne for the grapple to go through. Even if you don’t grab an enemy, this still does a large amount of damage to nearby officers, so it’s a good combo to use to beat the life out of a tough opponent.

## Weapon Build

My choices in **bold**, locked skills in _italics_.
{:.alert .alert-info}

- Choose one: Strong I, **Strong VI**, or Antitriangle
- Choose one: **Critical Focus**, Axebreaker, Swordbreaker, Lancebreaker
- **Armor Strike** 
- Choose one: **Mountslayer**, Plateslayer, Wingslayer, Dracoslayer
- Choose one: Mountslayer, Plateslayer, Wingslayer, **Dracoslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Warrior+, Critical+
- _Divine Favor_

Between Camilla and Minerva, I think one of them should run Antitriangle in order to differentiate the two further. For me, that is Camilla, so I took a Strong kill instead. `C1` and `C6` are Minerva's most powerful combos. `C1` is the stronger of the two, but I personally do not enjoy the dashing-`C1` spam playstyle, so I opted for `C6` instead.  I strongly recommend Critical Focus, but if you would rather not grind out the KOs then pick a breaker skill (Lancebreaker if you opt for Antitriangle).  Armor Strike helps to break down tough officers. Choose your Slayer skills based on availability and personal preference; the bolded skills are the most optimal if not using Antitriangle. Finally, Pair Up+ has great synergy with Minerva being a flying unit, but if you don't have any on hand, Warrior and Critical work just fine as well.

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

**Astra (Ryoma)**, **Luna (Chrom)**, **Luck +20 (Celica)**

- The biggest consistent damage boosters. Make sure to only run Luck +20 if you already have Luna equipped.

#### Vanguard Skills

Trample (Camilla), **Armored Blow (Tiki)**, Pass (Lyn), **Lethality (Niles)**, Iote's Sheild (Minerva), **Solidarity (Robin)**, Awakening (Lucina), Counter (Oboro)

- Trample is a great skill. Outstanding, even. However, as more boost skills come out, competition is getting tougher, and of the consistent damage boosters Trample is the most expendable. If you want a nice flat 10% boost on the most common enemy type in the game, this is the skill for you.
- Armored Blow is a wonderful skill especially considering Minerva's gigantic hitbox. Pass is Armored Blow lite, and is good for minimixing the risk carried by Armor Strike.
- Lethality is a great damage booster, but be sure to have Luck +20 equipped for maximum efficiency.
- Iote's Shield is a great skill to sub in if you want to take the fight to archers, but it's a skill that should be run on a case-by-case basis.
- Solidarity has great synergy with Minerva's role as a flier.
- Awakening is a solid damage boost while in Awakening mode.
- Counter is a solid option to open up stun gauges quickly.

#### Support Skills

**Trample (Camilla)**, **Solidarity (Robin)**, Dracoshield (Corrin), **Lone Wolf (Navarre)**, Iote's Shield (Minerva)

- Lone Wolf is a great skill for an AI controlled unit, considering that they are often on their own if they are not in the back of a Pair Up.
- Iote's Shield allows Minerva to be fielded on maps with archers.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are great skills for a dedicated Pair-Up build.

## Conclusion

Minerva is really, really good. Her Luck lead and sky-high Strength when compared to Camilla puts her head-and-shoulders above her in terms of damage. Couple that with the amazing wyvern rider moveset and relative ease of obtaining her Opus scroll and you've got a fantastic unit on your hand.
