Hi everyone! Today’s guide is on the trio of archers: Sakura, Takumi, and Anna.

## Basic Info

### Sakura

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   745 |
| Str  |    78 |
| Mag  |   141 |
| Skl  |    89 |
| Spe  |   118 |
| Lck  |   124 |
| Def  |    57 |
| Res  |   163 |

She’s overall very much what you would expect from a Cleric, Strength aside. Her Magic, Luck, Speed, and Resistance are her definite standout stats. Her Strength and Skill are middling (thankfully, she doesn’t need Strength), and her HP and Defense are rather poor. Still, she has the highest flat offense of any of the archers, which is definitely neat. Her niche is similar to that of Lissa: Mage tank with **Topsy-Turvy**.

#### Staff

Always

#### Unique Weapon

Spellbane Yumi: **Wingslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

HP +50: increases HP by 50.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

### Takumi

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   871 |
| Str  |   124 |
| Mag  |     4 |
| Skl  |   183 |
| Spe  |   146 |
| Lck  |   134 |
| Def  |    57 |
| Res  |    66 |

My goodness, that Skill. If you couldn’t tell just by looking at it, Takumi has by far the highest Skill in the game, making his crits and warrior specials extremely potent. In general, he is a character of extremes: his Skill, Strength, Luck, and Speed are all very high, but his Defense and Resistance are poor, and his Magic is the lowest in the game at 4. Despite having a lower flat attacking stat than his sister, Takumi is by far the most offense-oriented archer.

#### Staff

Never ~~what a shock, lol 4 mag~~

#### Unique Weapon

Fujin Yumi: **Wingslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Skill +10: Increases Skill by 10.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Speed (+5 with A/A+, otherwise +3)

### Anna

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   781 |
| Str  |    99 |
| Mag  |    85 |
| Skl  |   102 |
| Spe  |   126 |
| Lck  |   153 |
| Def  |    88 |
| Res  |    96 |

Anna has a deceptively good stat spread. It's pretty average across the board, with her only standout stats being her Luck and Speed. Thankfully, with Luna, her Luck can shore up her so-so offenses by a lot. While her Resistance is poor compared to Sakura’s, she is overall the bulkiest of the archers. She also has the option of running **Topsy-Turvy**, but Sakura does it so much better that it’s not really worth it.

#### Staff

Never ~~I triple checked this because I couldn’t believe it either~~

#### Unique Weapon

None

#### Unique Skill

Payday: Receive more gold. Increases with Luck.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Skill/Speed/Luck (+5 with A/A+, otherwise +3)

#### Unique Trait

Can open chests without a key.

## Moveset

_Note that the archer `C1` charges by holding the `X` button._

**`C1` (0-2.9 seconds charged):** The unit quickly shoots three arrows in a straight line, which do low damage. Pressing `X` repeatedly allows the unit to rapid-fire the arrows. This is a pretty hilarious move, especially with Astra. It’s not really optimal given its low damage, but as each hit stuns on hit, you can easily cheese officers with this move.

**`C1` (3-5.9 seconds charged):** The unit fires a green orb in a straight line, exposing a white stun gauge on all foes hit. This move… man, if only the charge time weren’t so long. Three seconds isn’t too bad, I guess, but you don’t want to be standing still that long around officers, especially when all you get is a white stun gauge.

**`C1` (6 seconds charged):** The unit fires a large energy blast in an ‘X’ formation, dealing moderate damage and exposing a yellow stun gauge on all enemies hit. This might be a controversial opinion, but I don’t like this attack at all. Yellow stun gauges are a wonderful thing to have free access to on any unit… but not at the cost of standing still for 6 seconds. That’s 6 seconds of standing still, praying you don’t get hit (and if you don’t have Armored Blow, the charge will be cancelled if you do get hit), not doing any DPS whatsoever. Astra doesn’t speed up the charge time, either. For context, with Astra, the archer regular combo comes out in about 5 seconds. The entire regular combo comes out faster than this one move.

**`C2`:** The unit uppercuts nearby enemies with their bow and slashes sideways. A pretty good launcher that combos very well with their naturally juggle-heavy regular string.

**`C3`:** The unit fires into the sky, calling down an arrow rain that does damage to all nearby enemies for about 3 seconds. This move is actually pretty decent. It can rack up some fairly significant damage on officers with good positioning.

**`C4`:** The unit jumps into the air and fires an arrow at the ground, unleashing a tornado that travels a long distance in front. This is a pretty neat long-range crowd clearer that also does moderate damage to officers in the path.

**`C5`:** The unit fires an orb of energy directly in front of them, which then rapid-fires arrows in three directions (forward and diagonally left and right). This combo absolutely decimates crowds and officer stun gauges. This is also your best option for increasing your warrior gauge quickly.

**`C6`:** The unit slices the area around them with wind, which then explodes outwards, damaging enemies in a moderate area around the unit. Compared to other `C6`s in the game, this one is a bit… underwhelming, in my opinion. Still, it does do a lot of damage to officers, so it has that going for it.

## Weapon Builds

### Sakura

- **Strong V**
- Choose one: **Strong III**, **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one: **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Plateslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Warrior+**, Crit+

`C5` is, in my opinion, the best archer combo. It’s your choice between the two officer killers: **Strong III** and **Strong VI**. **Rainstorm** is a given. **Topsy-Turvy** is also a given, allowing her to use her vastly superior Magic stat as her main source of offense. Since she has a legendary weapon, you also get your choice of a slayer skill. None of these are a standout favorite, so choose whichever suits your needs best. As usual, you can choose between Crit+, **Pair Up+**, and **Warrior+**. I think Pair Up is the best, personally, but all 3 are solid.

### Takumi

- Choose one: **Strong III** or **Awaken Gift**
- **Strong V**
- Choose one: **Strong VI** or **Awaken Gift**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**, **Plateslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Warrior+**, Crit+

Hey, look! No need to choose between **Strong III** and **Strong VI** if you don’t want to. The perks of having 3 magic, eh? However, if you’re soured by archers not building Awakening naturally, you can always take **Awaken Gift**. For your slayer skill, again choose whichever suits your needs, but be sure not to take the same as Sakura. I personally think **Plateslayer** is the best on him, as those units have high Defense, but all 3 are worth consideration. **Pair Up+** is once again is the most consistent option, but Takumi’s crits and warrior specials are absolutely massive, so no shame in choosing either of those.

### Anna

- **Strong III**
- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Pair Up+**
- Choose one: **Awaken Gift**, **Strong IV**, **Topsy-Turvy**

Since Anna doesn’t have a legendary bow, feel free to run both **Strong III** and **Strong VI**. **Pair Up+** helps a ton with her damage, and is preferred over the other 5K skills. For your last slot, I recommend **Awaken Gift** for the reasons I mentioned in Takumi section. You could also take **Strong IV**, or **Topsy-Turvy** if you hate Sakura and refuse to use her (how could you though?!?).

## Conclusion

The archers are pretty solid picks. I think they are all roughly equal. If I were to call one the best, I think Anna has the most potential. After running calculations, I think Anna is potentially better than either of the royal archers with a full Luck build, having insanely high damage while also sporting impressive bulk with Aegis and Pavise. However, Sakura's Luck is also very high and she has great Magic, allowing her to take on foes she cannot. For Takumi's part, his massive Skill maxes his warrior specials and crits the most potent in the entire game. They make good pair up partners (especially Anna for the spicy +5 Luck), and when it comes to AoE, they are unrivaled. They are also excellent jugglers, and indeed rely on juggling to dish out damage. The only thing they really sorely lack is a reliable way to open up stun gauges without having to stand still for a minimum of 3 seconds. Still, when you need to round out a team comp or assassinate some fliers, consider using an archer.
