Hi everyone! Today’s guide is on the trio of archers: Sakura, Takumi, and Anna.

## Basic Info

### Sakuras

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   745 |
| Str  |    78 |
| Mag  |   141 |
| Skl  |    89 |
| Spe  |   118 |
| Lck  |   124 |
| Def  |    57 |
| Res  |   163 |
{: .table .table-sm .stats}

She’s overall very much what you would expect from a Cleric, Strength aside. Her Magic, Luck, Speed, and Resistance are her definite standout stats. Her Strength and Skill are middling (thankfully, she doesn’t need Strength), and her HP and Defense are rather poor. Still, she has the highest flat offense of any of the archers, which is definitely neat. Her niche is similar to that of Lissa: Mage tank with **Topsy-Turvy**.

#### Staff

#### Unique Weapon

Spellbane Yumi: **Wingslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** (**Divine Favor** with Fates DLC) in 8th

#### Unique Skill

### Takumi

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   871 |
| Str  |   124 |
| Mag  |     4 |
| Skl  |   183 |
| Spe  |   146 |
| Lck  |   134 |
| Def  |    57 |
| Res  |    66 |
{: .table .table-sm .stats}

My goodness, that Skill. If you couldn’t tell just by looking at it, Takumi has by far the highest Skill in the game, making his crits and warrior specials extremely potent. In general, he is a character of extremes: his Skill, Strength, Luck, and Speed are all very high, but his Defense and Resistance are poor, and his Magic is the second lowest in the game at 4. Despite having a lower flat attacking stat than his sister, Takumi is by far the most offense-oriented archer.

#### Staff

Never ~~what a shock, lol 4 mag~~

#### Unique Weapon

Fujin Yumi: **Wingslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** (**Divine Favor** with Fates DLC) in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Skill +10: Increases Skill by 10.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Speed (+5 with A/A+, otherwise +3)

### Anna

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   781 |
| Str  |    99 |
| Mag  |    85 |
| Skl  |   102 |
| Spe  |   126 |
| Lck  |   153 |
| Def  |    88 |
| Res  |    96 |
{: .table .table-sm .stats}

Anna has a deceptively good stat spread. It's pretty average across the board, with her only standout stats being her Luck and Speed. Thankfully, with Luna, her Luck can shore up her so-so offenses by a lot. While her Resistance is poor compared to Sakura’s, she is overall the bulkiest of the archers. She also has the option of running **Topsy-Turvy**, but Sakura does it so much better that it’s not really worth it.

#### Staff

Never ~~I triple checked this because I couldn’t believe it either~~

#### Unique Weapon

Anna's Bow (with Shadow Dragon DLC): **Winglsayer** in 7th slot, **True Power**/**Divine Favor** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Payday: Receive more gold. Increases with Luck.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Skill/Speed/Luck (+5 with A/A+, otherwise +3)

#### Unique Trait

Can open chests without a key.

## Moveset

Note that the archer `C1` charges by holding `X`.
{:.alert .alert-info}

**`C1`: (0-2.9 seconds charged):** The unit quickly shoots three arrows in a straight line, which do low damage. Pressing `X` repeatedly allows the unit to rapid-fire the arrows. This is a pretty hilarious move, especially with **Astra**. It’s not really optimal given its low damage, but as each hit stuns on hit, you can easily cheese officers with this move — it will just take a while.

**`C1` (3-5.9 seconds charged):** The unit fires a green orb in a straight line, exposing a white stun gauge on all foes hit. **Astra** speeds up the charge, but you generally want to commit to the full charge for the bonus damage and yellow stun gauge.

**`C1` (6 seconds charged):** The unit fires a large energy blast in an 'X' formation over a long distance, dealing a large amount damage and exposing a yellow stun gauge on all enemies hit. This attack is great _if_ you have **Armored Blow** and **Astra**. **Astra** halves the charge time and **Armored Blow** prevents enemies from interrupting you. Use it from a long distance to set up a big critical strike, then rinse and repeat to your satisfaction. Just make sure you have the proper skills when using it, otherwise you will be a sitting duck.

**`C2`:** The unit uppercuts nearby enemies with their bow and slashes sideways. A pretty good launcher that combos very well with their naturally juggle-heavy regular string.

**`C3`:** The unit fires into the sky, calling down an arrow rain that does damage to all nearby enemies for about 3 seconds. This move is actually pretty decent. It can rack up some fairly significant damage on officers with good positioning.

**`C4`:** The unit jumps into the air and fires an arrow at the ground, unleashing a tornado that travels a long distance in front. This is a pretty neat long-range crowd clearer that also does moderate damage to officers in the path.

**`C5`:** The unit fires an orb of energy directly in front of them, which then rapid-fires arrows in three directions (forward and diagonally left and right). This combo absolutely decimates crowds and officer stun gauges. This is also your best option for increasing your warrior gauge quickly.

**`C6`:** The unit slices the area around them with wind, which then explodes outwards, damaging enemies in a moderate area around the unit. Compared to other `C6`s in the game, this one is a bit… underwhelming, in my opinion. Still, it does do a lot of damage to officers, so it has that going for it.

## Weapon Builds

My choices in **bold**, locked skills in _italics_.
{:.alert .alert-info}

### Sakura

#### Vanilla

- **Strong I**
- **Critical Focus**
- Choose one: **Armor Strike**, Strong III, Strong IV, or Rainstorm
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one: Mountslayer, **Dracoslayer,** Plateslayer
- Choose one: **Pair Up+,** Warrior+, Crit+
- _Wingslayer_
- _True Power_

Fully charged `C1` is very powerful and worth a boost. **Critical Focus** is a great skill that allows Sakura to break stun gauges faster. Since Sakura should be running **Armored Blow** anyway, I strongly recommend using **Armor Strike**. If you prefer a lower risk playstyle, **Rainstorm**, **Strong III**, or **Strong IV** also work. **Topsy-Turvy** allows Sakura to use her large Magic stat and target enemy Resistance. Choose whatever slayer skill you like best. **Mountslayer** edges out the other two due to the high Resistance sported by Leo and Elise, but it is ultimately your choice. Finally, take a 5k skill. **Pair Up+** is the strongest, but **Warrior+** and **Crit+** are solid budget options.

#### DLC

- **Strong I**
- **Critical Focus** or Tomebreaker
- Choose one: **Armor Strike** or Rainstorm
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one: Mountslayer, **Dracoslayer**, Plateslayer
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Warrior+, Crit+
- _Wingslayer_
- _Divine Favor_

Fully charged `C1` is very powerful and worth a boost. **Critical Focus** is a great skill that allows Sakura to break stun gauges faster. However, if you would rather not farm out the 4k KOs, **Tomebreaker** allows Sakura to overcome the usual high Resistance stat of tome users without having to give up **Topsy-Turvy**. Since Sakura should be running **Armored Blow** anyway, I strongly recommend using **Armor Strike**. If you prefer a lower risk playstyle, **Rainstorm** also works. **Topsy-Turvy** allows Sakura to use her large Magic stat and target enemy Resistance. Choose whatever slayer skill you like best. **Mountslayer** edges out the other two due to the high Resistance sported by Leo and Elise, but it is ultimately your choice. Finally, take a 5k skill. **Pair Up+** is the strongest, but **Warrior+** and **Crit+** are solid budget options.

### Takumi

#### Vanilla

- **Strong I**
- **Critical Focus**
- Choose one: Rainstorm, Strong III, Strong IV, or **Armor Strike**
- Choose one: **Rainstorm**, Strong III, Strong IV, or Armor Strike 
- Choose one: Mountslayer, Dracoslayer, **Plateslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+,** Warrior+, Crit+
- _Wingslayer_
- _True Power_

Fully charged `C1` is very powerful and worth a boost. Since Takumi should be running **Armored Blow** anyway, I strongly recommend using **Armor Strike**. **Critical Focus** is a great skill that helps with breaking stun gauges. The non-**Strong I** combo skills are very flexible, so drop one of them for **Armor Strike** (or use two of them if you don't like it). Choose whatever slayer skill you like best. **Plateslayer** edges out the other two due to the high Defense sported by armored enemies, but it is ultimately your choice. Finally, take a 5k skill. **Pair Up+** is the strongest, but **Warrior+** and **Crit+** are solid budget options.

#### DLC

- **Strong I**
- Choose one: Rainstorm, Strong III, Strong IV, or **Armor Strike**
- **Critical Focus**
- Choose one: **Swordbreaker**, Lancebreaker, Axebreaker, or Bowbreaker
- Choose one: Mountslayer, Dracoslayer, **Plateslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Warrior+, Crit+
- _Wingslayer_
- _Divine Favor_

Fully charged `C1` is very powerful and worth a boost. Since Takumi should be running **Armored Blow** anyway, I strongly recommend using **Armor Strike**. If you don't like **Armor Strike**, use a combo skill instead. **Critical Focus** is a great skill that helps with breaking stun gauges.  Choose whatever slayer skill you like best. **Plateslayer** edges out the other two due to the high Defense sported by armored enemies, but it is ultimately your choice. Finally, take a 5k skill. **Pair Up+** is the strongest, but **Warrior+** and **Crit+** are solid budget options.

### Anna

#### Vanilla (Hero Bow)

- **Strong I**
- **Critical Focus**
- Choose one: Rainstorm, Strong III, Strong IV, or **Armor Strike** 
- Choose one: **Rainstorm,** Strong III, Strong IV, or Armor Strike 
- Choose one: Rainstorm, **Strong III,** Strong IV, or Armor Strike 
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Warrior+, Crit+
- _Wingslayer_

Fully charged `C1` is very powerful and worth a boost. Since Anna should be running **Armored Blow** anyway, I strongly recommend using **Armor Strike**. **Critical Focus** is a great skill that helps with breaking stun gauges. The non-**Strong I** combo skills are very flexible, so drop one of them for **Armor Strike** (or use three of them if you don't like it). Finally, take a 5k skill. **Pair Up+** is the strongest, but **Warrior+** and **Crit+** are solid budget options.

#### DLC (Anna's Bow)

- **Strong I**
- Choose one: Rainstorm, Strong III, Strong IV, or **Armor Strike** 
- **Critical Focus**
- Choose one: Swordbreaker, **Lancebreaker,** Axebreaker, or Bowbreaker
- Choose one: **Mountslayer,** Dracoslayer, Plateslayer
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Warrior+, Crit+
- _Wingslayer_
- _Divine Favor_

Fully charged `C1` is very powerful and worth a boost. Since Anna should be running **Armored Blow** anyway, I strongly recommend using **Armor Strike**. If you don't like **Armor Strike**, use a combo skill instead. **Critical Focus** is a great skill that helps with breaking stun gauges. Since Anna's Bow gets **Divine Favor**, you can and should run a slayer skill, so choose the one you like best. **Plateslayer** edges out the other two due to the high Defense sported by armored enemies, but it is ultimately your choice. Finally, take a 5k skill. **Pair Up+** is the strongest, but **Warrior+** and **Crit+** are solid budget options.

## Conclusion

The three vanilla archers are pretty solid picks. Anna, especially after getting a unique bow in the Shadow Dragon DLC, has the highest DPS potential with her monstrous Luck stat; however, Sakura’s Luck is also very high and she has great Magic, allowing her to take on foes she cannot. For Takumi’s part, his massive Skill maxes his warrior specials and crits the most potent in the entire game. They make good pair up partners (especially Anna for the spicy +5 Luck), and when it comes to AoE, they are nearly unrivaled. They are also excellent jugglers, and indeed rely on juggling to dish out damage. Their `C1`s are less reliable than the Mages', but still fantastic provided you have the right skills.
