Aside from her Defense and Resistance, Human Tiki’s stats are just bad, plain and simple. Dragon Tiki on the other hand has solid offenses, and despite her very low HP pool, her Defense and Resistance are extraordinary. Tiki is the only character in the game that uses both her Strength and Magic to calculate her damage, so thankfully neither of those stats are wasted in any way. She also gets a minor movement boost (from 6 to 8), which is pretty neat too.

#### Weaknesses

**Dracoslayer**

## Moveset

### Human Tiki

**`C1`:** Tiki raises her dragonstone in the air, dealing a very small amount of damage. This combo converts her Warrior gauge into her Awakening gauge, with one bar of Warrior gauge being equal to 1/3 of the Awakening gauge. Here it is, everyone: the best combo in the entire game. This is what makes Tiki function as a character. Even just two bars of warrior meter is enough to let her transform, though 3 bars gives her the maximum duration.

**`C2`:** Tiki conjures a giant dragonstone from the ground, launching enemies hit. As Tiki is very reliant on breaking gauges, and juggling helps a lot with that, this is a pretty valuable combo.

**`C3`:** Tiki slides forward a very short distance. This is a pretty worthless combo, frankly. Its spammability does not make up for the fact that it has almost no reach or damage.

**`C4`:** Tiki turns around and flaps her wings a few times, exposing the stun gauge on any foe hit. This is one half of Human Tiki’s main way of doing damage. More than probably anyone else in the game, she absolutely needs to break gauges to deal damage, so being able to expose them on any enemy type is certainly nice.

**`C5`:** Tiki throws her dragonstone up into the air skips a few times before a giant dragonstone comes crashing down on nearby foes. This is an ok stun gauge breaker if the skips connect, but Tiki needs to be rather close for that to happen.

**`C6`:** Tiki calls down a few beams of light from the sky, followed by a large dragonstone coming up from underground. Hey, an actually decent damaging combo for Human Tiki! This is pretty much your bread and butter with her, as it easily has the largest range and damage of any of her human form combos. It’s also pretty good at breaking stun gauges.

### Dragon Tiki

**`Y1` (Dash):** Tiki spins around and slams onto the ground. This is a pretty good way to enter a fight out of a dash, or to hit and run between objectives.

**`C1` (Standard):** Tiki roars at the sky, dealing damage to nearby enemies. This combo converts her Warrior gauge into her Awakening gauge, with one bar of Warrior gauge being equal to 1/3 of the Awakening gauge. Tiki’s critical is absolutely wonderful at building up the Warrior gauge, and this combo is key to keeping her in her powerful dragon form as long as possible.

**`C1` (Dash):** Tiki launches an ice blast from her mouth at her feet, dealing damage in a moderate area. This is an alright combo, but she has much, much better area clearers. **Please be aware that this combo does not convert her warrior gauge,** so come to a full stop if you want to use the standard `C1`.

**`C2`:** Tiki swipes forward with her tail, launching enemies hit. Launchers are pretty cool, but dragon Tiki has no real need for juggling, as she can brute force her way past nearly any enemy.

**`C3`:** Tiki gets down on all fours and fires an energy beam in a very wide arc in front of her. What a fantastic crowd clearer this is, and even does some decent damage to officers to boot.

**`C4`:** Tiki spirals forward a short distance and roars. This combo exposes a yellow stun gauge on any foe hit. Sounds pretty good, but her basic string also exposes the gauge without the long animation, so you probably won’t use it much for that. Instead, the main draw of this combo is that it is a great way to build the Warrior gauge, so use it on large crowds when you find you are running low.

**`C5`:** Tiki begins to fly, firing a constant energy beam at the ground during her airtime that sways from side to side. Tiki can be freely controlled while she flies, though she is very slow, so this is not a good combo to use if you want to travel. This combo literally one shots any exposed stun gauge except maybe the last boss’s. With that said, I personally do not like using this combo for anything but gauge breaking, as the flight time cannot be cancelled by anything other than Tiki critting someone and the range isn’t too large. If Tiki’s Awakening gauge reaches zero mid-flight, she will finish the attack before reverting. You can use this combo to extend Awakening’s runtime a bit if you want to put your Warrior gauge towards a new transformation altogether.

**`C6`:** Tiki flies a short distance into the air, conjuring a large circle of light in front of her.  Enemies within the circle are damaged for a short time before Tiki crashes down onto the circle, dealing a huge amount of damage. This is a great catch-all combo: it does a ton of damage, it breaks stun gauges, and it clears a sizeable area. You can’t ask for more in a combo than this other than maybe a faster animation.

## Weapon Build

### Vanilla

- **Strong III**
- **Strong IV**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one: **Awaken Gift**, **Warrior Gift**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, Triangle+, **Critical+**

`C6` is pretty easily Tiki’s best damaging combo in both forms. `C3` is her main crowd clearer in dragon form, and `C4` is useful in both forms, albeit for different reasons. **Awaken Gift** is normally optional, but Tiki is the exception: anything that lets he stay in Awakening longer is very useful. Alternatively, you can run **Warrior Gift** if you’d rather have more control over when you transform. For your 5k skill, **Pair Up+** will boost her damage in both forms while paired, Triangle+ will boost her damage as a dragon, paired or not, and **Critical+** is fairly helpful for her human form while also having some use in her dragon form. **DO NOT run Warrior+**. There’s no real reason to use Tiki’s Warrior special ever.

### DLC

#### Divinestone

- **Armor Strike**
- **Fury Builder**
- Choose one: Swordbreaker, Axebreaker, **Lancebreaker**
- Choose one: Pair Up+, **Triangle+**, Critical+
- Choose one: **Amped** or Critical Focus
- Choose one: Wingslayer, Plateslayer, or **Mountslayer**
- _Dracoslayer_
- _Divine Favor_

What Tiki can't kill in one critical will certainly go down pretty quickly after thanks to Armor Strike. Her critical also hits in a massive area, which will spread the debuff to surrounding officers. Fury Builder synergizes very well with Tiki — deploying her is effecitvely committing yourself to playing her for most of the map anyway, so it's best to get a nice boost out of it. Next, a breaker of choice — make sure to keep your chosen Slayers in mind to optimize damage. Choose a 5k skill — Triangle+ is always active while in Awakening mode, Pair Up+ requires a Pair Up but also helps out baby Tiki, and Critical+ is a solid budget option. Amped helps Tiki out quite a bit with damage output, survivabilitiy, and Awakening duration. Finally, choose your other Slayer to compliment the built in Dracoslayer.

### Mandatory skills

**Astra (Ryoma)**, **Luna (Chrom)**, **Luck+20 (Celica)**

- The three most consistent damage boosters.
- At Level 150, Luna will ignore ~28% of foes' Def/Res. With Luck +20, this goes up to ~33%, and adding Amped on top of that boosts it to 38%. 

### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Lethality (Niles), **Galeforce (Olivia)**, **Awakening (Lucina)**, **Lone Wolf (Navarre)**, Iote's Shield (Minerva), Resonating Power (Owain), Trample (Camilla), Vengeance (Tharja)

- Armored Blow can be useful on baby Tiki, and she gets it for cheap. However, with how easy it is to build Awakening charge between Galeforce and dancer C1s, it's hard to justify the slot.
- At level 150, Lethality has a 55% activation rate. With Luck +20, this increases to 65%, and adding Amped on top of that increases it to 76%. 
- Galeforce lets Tiki enter Awakening mode absurdly fast and potentially stay there for the entire duration of the map when coupled with her C1.
- Awakening is a nice damage boost while in Awakening mode, and synergizes very well with Galeforce.
- Lone Wolf is a huge damage boost when not paired up, which Tiki can afford not to be.
- Iote's Shield lets Tiki avoid the Falchion users that crop up every now and then.
- Tiki's Strength and Magic are very close, giving her a solid boost from Resonating Power.
- Trample is wholly outclassed by Resonating Power, but can be an option for those lacking the Awakening DLC.
- Vengeance is a very high risk, high reward skill. The damage boost it gives is absolutely massive, but be sure to have all of your prayer crests purchased, and ideally some potions to drink. 

Please remember that Tiki should not ever be run as an AI unit. If you deploy her, you should be playing as her most, if not all of the time.

## Conclusion

What is there to say about Tiki, other than she’s pretty easily one of the best characters in the game? She’s a bit painful to play as early on in a battle, but once she gets the ball rolling, she’s an unstoppable juggernaut. She can easily hold her Warrior gauge until she needs to convert it, too — don’t feel pressured to keep it running if you don’t have to. She hits incredibly hard and is absurdly tanky, and has great matchups against basically any enemy. With that said, Tiki’s #1 flaw is that if you deploy her, you’re pretty much forced to play her. She can’t do anything as an AI unit, so it’s harder to take advantage of character swapping if she is on the team. She can be kept safe in the back of a Pair Up though, and she enjoys being paired with a mounted character for extra movement, or Corrin for the near perfect stat boosts they provide her. Tiki is absolutely worth investment if you have not invested in her already.
