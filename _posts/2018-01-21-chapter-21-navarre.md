Navarre is an offensive powerhouse, sporting solid Luck, Strength, and especially Skill stats. His defenses are fairly poor, but they are slightly offset by his large HP pool. He's a few steps up from "glass cannon," but still relatively frail.

## Moveset

**`C1`:** Navarre quickly dashes forward a decent distance. This is a nice gapcloser, but not much else.

**`C2`:** Navarre leaps into the air while slashing enemies in front, launching enemies hit. While airborne, she can use “Y” to use basic attacks as she falls, or “X” to slam directly down onto the ground. If you want to begin a juggle, just let Navarre drop.

**`C3`:** Navarre spins forward a short distance and then slashes vertically. This is a nice short range crowd clearer that is quite spammable.

**`C4`:** Navarre dashes straight up into the air in a zig-zag pattern, then uses both of her blades to slash in an “X” formation. This combo renders her airborne, where she has the same options as detailed in `C2`. This combo also exposes the stun gauge on any foe that doesn’t have WTA over her. This one is a bit tricky, but if you let Navarre drop immediately after the “X” slash, she can then immediately start juggling whatever unlucky officer got their stun gauge exposed.

**`C5`:** Navarre spins forward up to 5 times with each press of the `X` button, finishing it off with a diagonal slash. This combo is an ok stun gauge breaker, but where it really shines is the amount of agency you have in deciding just how far you want her to go while attacking. She can clear a very long distance with all 5 `X` presses, making it a great crowd clearer as she moves from place to place. With fewer `X` presses, she can use it to duel officers without leaving them behind.

**`C6`:** Navarre leaps into the air and dashes in multiple directions faster than the eye can follow. Enemies hit are dragged up into the air with her in the center of the area she is dashing. She finishes the combo with a giant slash in an “X” formation, dealing a huge amount of damage to enemies hit. This combo is utterly fantastic, up there with the best of them. `C6` allows Navarre to clear huge crowds while focusing down multiple officers at a time.

## Weapon Skills

My choices in **bold**, locked skills in _italics_.
{:.alert .alert-info}

- Choose one: **Strong VI**, Rainstorm, Critical Focus, Antitriangle
- Choose one: **Swordbreaker**, Lancebreaker, Axebreaker, Critical Focus
- **Armor Strike**
- Choose one: Plateslayer, **Mountslayer**, Wingslayer
- Choose one: Plateslayer, Mountslayer, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: Pair Up+, **Critical+**, Warrior+
- _Divine Favor_

For the first slot, Strong VI and Rainstorm boost Navarre's best combos. Alternatively, Critical Focus is a higher investment choice that allows him to score criticals more frequently, while Antitriangle can help to differentiate himself from Lyn. Next, choose a breaker (you can take Critical Focus here as well, if you wish). Armor Strike is fantastic for breaking through tough lategame enemies. Next, choose two slayers- ideally, whichever two you didn't take on Lyn, for maximum coverage. Finally, take a 5k skill. Pair Up+ is the best one, but Critical+ and Warrior+ are good budget options.

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

**Astra (Ryoma)**, **Luna (Chrom)**, **Luck +20 (Celica)**

- The biggest consistent damage boosters. Make sure to only run Luck +20 if you already have Luna equipped.

#### Vanguard Skills

**Trample (Camilla)**, **Armored Blow (Tiki)**, Pass (Lyn), **Lethality (Niles)**, Lone Wolf (Navarre), Solidarity (Robin), Awakening (Lucina), Counter (Oboro)

- Trample offers a nice damage boost against foot units, by far the most common enemy type.
- Armored Blow, and Pass to a lesser degree, make it easier to close the distance against raged foes and reduce the risk presented by Armor Strike.
- Lethality is a great damage booster, but be sure to have Luck +20 equipped for maximum efficiency.
- Lone Wolf is a solid skill, especially for maps that only allow one unit to be deployed.
- Solidarity is a good choice when pair-swapping.
- Awakening is a decent damage boost while in Awakening mode.
- Counter is a solid option to open up stun gauges quickly.

#### Support Skills

**Trample (Camilla)**, **Solidarity (Robin)**, Dracoshield (Corrin), **Lone Wolf (Navarre)**

- Lone Wolf is a great skill for an AI controlled unit, considering that they are often on their own if they are not in the back of a Pair Up.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are great skills for a dedicated Pair-Up build.

## Conclusion

Navarre is like Lyn, but ever so slightly better thanks to his minor Luck lead, so if you're looking for the best one, look no further. The dual swords moveset is my personal favorite, offering high speed, power, and general 'cool factor.' Navarre is definitely worth the investment, carving a space for himself as one of the best of many sword units.
