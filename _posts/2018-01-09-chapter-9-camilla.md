Hi everyone! Today’s guide is on the eldest royal sister of Nohr, and our only pre-DLC wyvern rider: Camilla.

## Basic Info

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   847 |
| Str  |   192 |
| Mag  |    99 |
| Skl  |   108 |
| Spe  |   116 |
| Lck  |    68 |
| Def  |   120 |
| Res  |    54 |

Poor Luck aside, Camilla is an offensive powerhouse, sporting great Strength with surprisingly high magic. Her Skill is pretty high as well, along with her Speed (although Speed is a relatively bad stat). She’s decently physically bulky as well, being by far the best flying physical tank, though her Res is rather poor.

#### Staff

Never

#### Unique Weapon

Camilla’s Axe: no 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th slot

#### Unique Skill

Trample: Increases damage dealt to foot soldiers by 10%.

**Pair up bonus as support:** Str/Def/Skill (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

_Note that Camilla’s standard `C1` charges by attacking enemies. Her dashing `C1` is unaffected by the charge meter._

**`Y1` (Dash):** Camilla’s wyvern lands on the ground and slides forward, dealing a small amount of damage to enemies. This is a much better way to initiate a fight than stopping for a standard `Y1`.

**`C1` (Standard, 0-49% charge):** Camilla swipes horizontally with her axe. Pretty useless ‘combo.’

**`C1` (Standard, 50-99% charge):** Camilla swings her axe downward twice, with the first hit grabbing the first enemy hit. This is… not as good as the 100%, but an ok way to separate an officer from a crowd.

**`C1` (Standard, 100% charge):** Camilla quickly swings her axe and then slams it into the ground three times, with the third hit causing a small explosion. The first hit can grab. This is like a watered down version of her `C6`, however, it comes out much faster and is a good way to get some cheap damage on an officer.

**`C1` (Dash):** Camilla’s wyvern does a backflip and slams into the ground. Just like the Pegasus dashing `C1`, this is a great hit-and-run crowd clearer, and I’m fairly sure this hits a larger area than the Pegasus one. It’s also spammable, which is rather neat. You can basically spam this for most of a given map and that would be a successful strategy.

**`C2`:** Camilla’s wyvern does a backflip, launching nearby enemies. Camilla doesn’t have too many juggle starters (Y4 is her other main one), so this is quite a valuable attack, having good synergy with `C6` in particular.

**`C3`:** Camilla’s wyvern spins forward twice, and Camilla follows up with two slashes that form an ‘X’ shape. A pretty nice crowd clearer that has a fair bit of forward momentum.

**`C4`:** Camilla spins her axe above her head to conjure a massive fireball, which she then flings forward, damaging enemies in a large area. This combo will reveal the stun gauge of any foe that doesn’t have WTA over her. This is my personal favorite crowd clearer, as it hits a massive area and has the added utility of exposing weak points. The downside is that it takes a long time to charge up, so it is best used with Armored Blow from relative safety.

**`C5`:** Camilla slashes horizontally twice before tossing her axe in the air, carrying up enemies hit. She then follows them up and uses her wyvern to launch a fireball at the airborne enemies. This combo absolutely shreds stun gauges, as the axe toss hits multiple times on their way up into the air. Note that the fireball toss on this combo is not an effective crowd clearer.

**`C6`:** Camilla swipes upward with her axe, grabbing an airborne enemy if there is one. She then repeatedly slams her axe into the ground, with the final slam causing a fiery explosion that damages nearby enemies. This combo is utterly brutal. Note that she can potentially grab trash with this, and I’m fairly certain that her victim must be airborne for the grapple to go through. Even if you don’t grab an enemy, this still does a large amount of damage to nearby officers, so it’s a good combo to use to beat the life out of a tough opponent.

## Weapon Build

- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong III**, **Strong IV**
- Choose one: **Strong I**, **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Dracoslayer**
- **Mountslayer**
- Choose one: **Pair Up+**, **Critical+**, **Warrior+**

Camilla has so many good combos that it’s really hard to choose which to boost. Choose your favorite crowd clearer: `C1`, `C3` or `C4`. Bear in mind that `C1` (dash) hits an absolutely obscene area around her wyvern. I personally prefer `C4`. Then, choose your favorite officer killer: `C1` or `C6`. I prefer `C6`. I excluded **Strong V** since its only real use is to break stun gauges. **Rainstorm** is ever-present. **Dracoslayer** and **Mountslayer** are her best options, as **Wingslayer** and **Plateslayer** include matchups that are already in her favor. I feel that **Pair Up+** is her best 5k option, being a flier, but **Critical+** and **Warrior+** are decent enough to warrant mention. I’d like to give a quick mention to **Topsy-Turvy**, which you can run if you really want to. However, she really wants the skills I already listed, and Lissa is a better user of it anyway.

## Boost Skills

| Skill          | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------- | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Astra**      | **Ryoma**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Luna**       | **Chrom**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Trample**    | **Camilla** | **X** | **X** |
| Armored Blow   | Tiki        |   X   |       |
| Pass           | Lyn         |   X   |       |
| Luck +20       | Celica      |   X   |   X   |
| Str + 10       | Lissa       |   X   |   X   |
| Res +10        | Elise       |   X   |   X   |
| Skill +10      | Takumi      |   X   |       |
| Awakening      | Lucina      |   X   |       |
| Potent Potion  | Rowan       |   X   |   X   |
| Solidarity     | Robin       |   X   |   X   |
| Dracoshield    | Corrin      |   X   |   X   |

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- You might be thinking: ‘wow, aside from her crummy Luck and Res, Camilla seems so good! Does she have any Weaknesseses?’ And the answer is: yes, she does. Her moveset is so slow without Astra that it feels clunky to use. She is like an entirely different character with Astra. **This is the absolute highest priority for her.**
- On a happier note, she has the unique distinction of being able to get Trample for the low price of 3 Camilla's Belts.
- At maximum Luck, Camilla’s Luna will reduce foes’ Def/Res by roughly 34%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Luck +20 (Celica), Str +10 (Lissa), Res +10 (Elise), Skill +10 (Takumi), Awakening (Lucina), Potent Potion (Rowan), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- This is her other major weakness: her hitbox. It’s gigantic. Armored Blow is actually a higher priority for a player-controlled Camilla than Trample in my opinion. Pass is also very, very useful on her.
- Luck +20 is a great skill, boosting the Def/Res reduction on Luna to 39%.
- Str +10 is a flat damage boost, Res +10 can shore up a weakness, and Skill +10 is a good choice if you opt for Crit+.
- Speed is a not-so-useful stat, but she has a lot of it, which means she can use Awakening to decent effect.
- Potent Potion is always nice, allowing her to support her team.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are very nice to have, especially on a flier, who will be pair-swapping often.

#### Support Skills

Luck +20 (Celica), Str +10 (Lissa), Res +10 (Elise), Potent Potion (Rowan), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- These skills were covered sufficiently above.

## Conclusion

Camilla is an incredibly unique and powerful unit, being the only axe flier in the game. Stat-wise, she is effectively a flying tank, if that tank had really bad Luck and died in 4 hits to an archer. Her moveset is incredible — with Astra — and she has an answer to any situation that arises. She crushes crowds, brutalizes officers, and supports her team by flying them wherever they need to go. She’s a great pick for nearly any map, so long as there aren’t too many archers or Falchion users.
