Azura is, essentially, a walking Pegasus Knight in terms of stats. Her excellent Luck and Skill are basically all she needs to be a powerhouse offensively. Her strength is on the low end, but with a fully awakened Blessed Lance (or even a 5 star Hero Lance) that doesn't matter in the slightest. Her defense is poor even at max level, so be careful when facing physical enemies.

#### Unique Weapon

Blessed Lance (**Beastslayer** in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th)

#### Unique Skill

Amaterasu: When unit is the vanguard of a pair up, the support heals slowly over time.

#### Staff

Never

#### Weaknesses

None

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Speed (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

**`C1`:** Azura sings, granting all allies within a large radius Awakening and Warrior meter. The amount of meter granted increases based on how full Azura's special bar is. At maximum charge, Azura gives her allies one bar of Warrior meter and 1/3 of a bar of Awakening meter. The bar charges by attacking, and using specials will fill this bar, unlike other similarly charged `C1`s. This is a wonderful `C1`, up there with the best of them. In my experience, it has two major uses. The first is Tiki. By pairing up Azura and Tiki at the beginning of the match, you can bypass Tiki's poor earlygame by feeding her meter until she can transform. The other is dual specials. Azura can constantly feed her ally special meter, meaning every special can be a dual special should you so choose.

**`C2`:** Azura twirls her lance overhead and then swipes upward, causing a vertical spout of water to launch enemies. It's nice to have a launcher, but it's not strictly needed since Azura's basic string naturally juggles.

**`C3`:** Azura spins in place, causing a whirlpool to form around her, and then slashes diagonally downward. It's your typical short range crowd clearer, but unlike most other `C3`s it isn't too spammy, even with Astra.

**`C4`:** Azura sends a stream of water forward from the tip of her lance for a few seconds, and then slashes diagonally. This combo reveals the stun gauge of any opponent that doesn't have WTA over her. This is pretty much the same combo as Xander's `C4`, and like that combo, it's only really good for opening gauges.

**`C5`:** Azura twirls her lance overhead and slams it on the ground, shooting a wide wave forward that travels over a moderate distance. This is Azura's longest range attack and is very useful for breaking stun gauges and clearing narrow passageways. It's also quite good at destroying yellow stun gauges.

**`C6`:** Azura chants a familiar tune, conjuring a large whirlpool around her that does significant damage to enemies hit. This is one of the best ways to charge your dance gauge and is all around a very powerful combo. This is Azura's go-to combo for breaking white stun gauges.

## Weapon Skills

_My personal choices in italics._

_Blessed Lance_

- Choose one: _**Strong VI**_, **Rainstorm**
- **Pair Up+**
- Choose one: _**Axebreaker**_, **Lancebreaker**, **Bowbreaker**
- Choose one: _**Plateslayer**_, **Dracoslayer**, **Wingslayer**
- Choose one: _**Armor Strike**_, **Antitriangle**
- Choose one: **Fury Builder**, _**Rainstorm**_, **Strong VI**
- _**Beastslayer**_
- _**True Power**_

`C6` is Azura's most powerful combo, while **Rainstorm** gives her a boost on her basic string. Azura benefits pretty hugely from **Pair Up+**, as she should be constantly feeding meter to a paired ally. Breaker skills are generally more powerful than **Antitriangle**, though you could choose to shore up a neutral matchup with a Breaker skill and run **Antitriangle** in the 6th slot. **Armor Strike** is a risky skill, but the increase in damage on powerful targets is pretty huge. If you aren't a fan of **Armor Strike**, **Antitriangle** is an alright alternative (do not run **Axebreaker** with **Antitriangle** though). Finally, **Fury Builder** is rather useful if you plan on playing as Azura for the entire stage. Otherwise, whatever combo skill you didn't take at the beginning.

| Awakening      | Lucina      |   X   |
| Aegis          | Xander      |   X   |
| Pavise         | Frederick   |   X   |

*my personal choices in italics*

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla), Luck +20 (Celica)

- The big 4. The only note to make here is that Luck +20 doesn't do much for you unless Luna is already equipped.

#### Vanguard Skills

*Armored Blow (Tiki)*, Pass (Lyn), *Lethality (Niles)*, Counter (Oboro), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin), Awakening (Lucina), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick)

- Armored Blow and Pass help to negate the risks of **Armor Strike** (and are just generally very useful skills). Personally, I would at least run Armored Blow should you choose to run **Armor Strike**.
- Lethality has a lot of potential for boosting damage on crit, which couples well with **Armor Strike** and Luck +20.
- Counter allows another option to open up stun gauges, which can be particularly useful against annoying enemies like Archers or Mages.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are worth considering if you plan on using Azura as a meter battery for Tiki (or anyone else).
- Awakening is worth considering, especially if you choose to run **Fury Builder**.
- Aegis and Pavise are decent niche options for maps where you find you are taking too much damage, but are generally inferior to the other listed options.

#### Support Skills

**Do not run Azura as a green square unit.** Her major strength is in her `C1`, which she can't use as an AI unit. If you want an AI controlled infantry lancer, use Oboro.

## Conclusion

Azura is a great all-around unit. She can fit a support or offensive role depending on player preference, and sports a well balanced moveset with decent options for most situations. Her `C1` has fantastic utility and can be used either to boost her own damage output or enable her allies. Having **Beastslayer** for free, while not the ideal slayer to have, gives her some versatility on her weapon build as well.
