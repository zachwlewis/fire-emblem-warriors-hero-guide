Linde has a pretty fantastic stat pool, sporting a ton of Luck and extremely high Magic. Her other offensive stats are solid, sans Strength, and her Resistance is similarly good. On the physical side, she's made of paper, but that's standard fare for a mage.

## Moveset

**`C1` (0-49% charge):** Linde fires a handful of small balls of light forward that do negligible damage. Looks kinda cool but ultimately useless.

**`C1` (50-99% charge):** Linde fires a laser forward that exposes a white stun gauge on any officer hit. Somewhat useful, but fully charged is much better.

**`C1` (100% charge):** Linde conjures a large pillar of light and then fires three lasers forward in a triangle formation. All officers hit have a yellow stun gauge exposed. A fantastic skill that is Linde's main source of DPS.

**`C2`:** Linde conjures a pillar of light that launches enemies. A good way to start breaking white stun gauges if need be.

**`C3`:** Linde conjures a tornado directly in front of her. This is a fairly decent short-range crowd clearer. The animation is much quicker than `C5` or `C6`, but the damage and range is far lower.

**`C4`:** Linde conjures a short line of ice spikes which explode after traveling a short distance. This combo looks pretty cool, but I don't care much for it. The AoE is small and the range isn't terribly large either. It's an ok crowd clearer, but Linde has a lot of good crowd clearing options.

**`C5`:** Linde calls down lightning all around her before firing a large lightning blast diagonally downward from above her head. This is Linde's best stun gauge breaker, and is good at clearing narrow passageways. 

**`C6`:** Linde conjures three rows of fire that travel along the ground a short distance. Then, a large fireball begins to form above a series of small explosions. Finally, the fireball itself explodes, dealing a large amount of damage over a large area. This combo does some pretty respectable damage and is also her widest-range crowd clearer. It also fills the C1 and Warrior gauges very quickly.


## Weapon Builds

My choices in **bold**, locked skills in _italics_.
{:.alert .alert-info}

#### Aura

- Strong I, Strong V, **Strong VI**, Rainstorm
- **Critical Focus**, Tomebreaker
- **Armor Strike**
- **Mountslayer**, Wingslayer, Dracoslayer
- Mountslayer, **Wingslayer**, Dracoslayer
- **Pair Up+**, Warrior+, Critical+
- _Divine Favor_

`C1`, `C5`, and `C6` are Linde's strongest combos, so choose your favorite (or **Rainstorm**). **Critical Focus** is always a great choice, but if you'd rather not grind, opt for **Tomebreaker** or a second **Strong** skill instead. Being such a critical-focused character, **Armor Strike** is a no-brainer. Next, choose two **Slayer** skills. **Mountslayer** and **Wingslayer** offer the best coverage over areas Linde struggles with, but **Dracoslayer** is also a solid option. Finally, grab a 5k skill. As usual, **Pair Up+** is the strongest one, but if you don't have any on hand, **Warrior+** and **Critical+** are also solid choices.

## Boost Skills

{: .table .table-sm .skills}

#### Mandatory Skills

**Astra (Ryoma)**, **Luna (Chrom)**, **Luck +20 (Celica)**

- The biggest consistent damage boosters. Make sure to only run Luck +20 if you already have Luna equipped.

#### Vanguard Skills

Trample (Camilla), **Armored Blow (Tiki)**, Pass (Lyn), **Lethality (Niles)**, **Quick Wit (Linde)**, Solidarity (Robin), Awakening (Lucina)

- Trample is a great skill. Outstanding, even. However, as more boost skills come out, competition is getting tougher, and of the consistent damage boosters Trample is the most expendable. If you want a nice flat 10% boost on the most common enemy type in the game, this is the skill for you.
- Armored Blow is a wonderful skill especially considering the long cast times on Linde's abilities. Pass is Armored Blow lite, and is good for minimixing the risk carried by Armor Strike.
- Given Linde's high Luck and easy access to critical hits, Lethality is a no-brainer.
- Quick Wit is a very interesting skill that gives Linde a great way to get into Awakening mode. Not being able to get into Awakening easily is a pretty big weakness that mages in general have, so this is a very nice skill to have. Just remember, it only procs off of yellow stun gauges.
- Solidarity is a great damage boost if you pair-swap often.
- Awakneing pairs very well with Quick Wit for a more Awakening-focused build.

#### Support Skills

**Trample (Camilla)**, **Solidarity (Robin)**, Dracoshield (Corrin), **Lone Wolf (Navarre)**, Live to Serve (Lianna)

- Lone Wolf is a great skill for an AI controlled unit, considering that they are often on their own if they are not in the back of a Pair Up.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are great skills for a dedicated Pair-Up build.
- Live To Serve allows Linde to sustain herself in the field.

## Conclusion

In terms of stats, Linde outclasses all of the vanilla mages in terms of raw power. Her moveset has a large focus on AoE effects. This makes it very easy for her to build her `C1` gauge and eviscerate her enemies with critical hits. She is an outstanding unit, and I strongly recommend using her, especially if you prefer her moveset to that of the other mages.
