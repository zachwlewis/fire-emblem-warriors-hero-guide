---

Hello and welcome to my first FE Warriors character guide. This time, I’ll be covering the twin royals of Aytolis: Rowan and Lianna.

## Basic Info

### Rowan

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   867 |
| Str  |    97 |
| Mag  |    78 |
| Skl  |   121 |
| Spe  |   126 |
| Lck  |   121 |
| Def  |   106 |
| Res  |   102 |

Rowan's stats are balanced across the board, which is to be expected from a protagonist. His bulk is very solid, He's got great skill, speed, and luck, and while his offenses are on the lower side when compared to the whole cast, they are still solid.

#### Staff

Always

#### Unique Weapon

Enliron/Faccina, comes with **Beastslayer** free in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Potent Potion: When this unit heals with medicine, nearby units are also healed.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Luck (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

### Lianna

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   833 |
| Str  |    86 |
| Mag  |    98 |
| Skl  |   120 |
| Spe  |   117 |
| Lck  |   120 |
| Def  |   102 |
| Res  |   117 |

Lianna has a very similar stat spread to Rowan, losing some points in most stats for higher Resistance and Magic. As such, **Topsy-Turvy** is a must for her. Otherwise, she is extraordinarily well balanced.

#### Staff

Always

#### Unique Weapon

Enrilon/Faccina, comes with **Beastslayer** free in 7th slot, **True Power** in 8th

#### Unique Skill

Live to Serve: Then this unit heals an ally with a staff, this unit is also healed the same amount.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Str/Skill/Luck (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

**`C1`:** The unit slashes in an `X` formation repeatedly, hitting enemies in front. Pressing `X` multiple times extends the duration of the slash. This combo has some use as a stun gauge killer, but is wholly outclassed in that regard by `C5`.

**`C2`:** The unit spirals upward, carrying up any nearby enemies. The unit can press `Y` a few times on the way down for some extra light attacks, or `X` again to slam down on the ground. This combo is… meh. Launchers are nice, but since Rowan/Lianna also goes up, they can’t use this to juggle. However, a paired up ally *can* use it to juggle if you switch while the enemy is in midair. This takes practice, and the enemy having an exposed stun gauge makes it easier to pull off.

**`C3`:** The unit spins a few times and then slashes forward. This is a solid area clearer, but overshadowed by `C4` and `C6`.

**`C4`:** The unit throws their shield around them in a circle of light, which then pushes outward in a moderate AoE, revealing the stun gauge on any unit that doesn’t have WTA over them. In the early game, this is not only a utility move, but also their best crowd clearer. `C6` outdoes it as a crowd clearer and general damage dealer, however, so it ultimately finds its niche in revealing the stun gauge.

**`C5`:** The unit jabs forward a few times with their sword, and then launches themselves and enemies in front into the air, where they have the same options as detailed in `C2`. This is their best stun gauge breaker. A raw `C5` on an axe (or lance, if using **Antitriangle**) breaks the stun gauge right before the launcher. `C5` will also break a white gauge exposed by `C4` most of the time, provided that you hit each regular attack leading into `C5`.

**`C6`:** The unit slashes 4 times with a long blade of light, and ends with a large horizontal slash. This attack can be aimed slightly after beginning it. This is your bread and butter crowd clearer. The range on the 5th slash is pretty huge, and this combo just does a lot of damage in general. Sadly, `C6` does not break any kind of full stun gauge, as units caught do hit the ground during the combo.

## Weapon Skills

### Rowan

- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- Choose one of: **Plateslayer**, **Wingslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**
- Choose one of: **Critical+**, **Pair Up+**, **Warrior+**
- Choose one of: **Strong IV**, **Antitriangle**, **Awaken Gift**

`C5` and `C6` are your bread and butter combos that you’re going to be using for just about everything, so definitely boost those up. **Rainstorm** is great on pretty much anyone, and Rowan is no exception.

For your second slayer skill, it’s really your call. I listed them in what I consider to be most useful to least. **Wingslayer** and **Plateslayer** turn two bad matchups (Pegasus Knights and Armor Knights) into winning ones, while having the added bonus of doing effective damage vs Wyvern Riders and Great Knights. **Mountslayer** is a solid option if you aren’t running that on anyone else/can’t seem to pull Wing or Plate, and **Dracoslayer**, while useful, is a little unnecessary with all of the Falchion users. For your 5k skill, it comes down to preference and convenience. These three are the most consistently useful. From what I have read, **Pair Up+** provides a 20% damage bonus to everything, including Warrior specials, while in Pair Up. The other two don’t rely on being paired up, but they are more limited in scope.

Your last slot is basically filler. `C4` is largely outclassed as an area clearer by `C6`, though since it exposes stun gauges for neutral matchups you will probably wind up using it a decent amount. **Antitriangle** is a pretty neat skill that you definitely want on a few of your sword units, and since Rowan has the slot space for it, it’s worth consideration. If you choose to run Anittriangle, opt for **Mountslayer** over **Plateslayer**. **Awaken Gift** is kind of mediocre but it’s by far the best of the 2k skills and it can be useful to build up Awakening on maps with a lot of neutral matchups.

### Lianna

- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose one of: **Critical+**, **Warrior+**, **Pair Up+**
- Choose one of: **Wingslayer**, **Plateslayer**, **Mountslayer**, **Dracoslayer**

Seeing as Lianna is basically the same as Rowan, their weapon builds are going to be pretty similar. However, there are some key differences. The most notable is that Lianna does not share Rowan’s flexible 6th slot, instead opting for **Topsy-Turvy** to take advantage of her high magic stat. On related note, **Topsy-Turvy** means that **Wingslayer** has an edge over **Plateslayer** for her, given that Pegasi have extremely high resistance. Everything else has been covered already in Rowan’s weapon set.

## Boost Skills

### Rowan

| Skill         | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------ | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Astra**     | **Ryoma**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Luna**      | **Chrom**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Trample**   | **Camilla** | **X** | **X** |
| Armored Blow  | Tiki        |   X   |       |
| Pass          | Lyn         |   X   |       |
| Luck +20      | Celica      |   X   |       |
| Str +10       | Lissa       |   X   |   X   |
| Live To Serve | Lianna      |   X   |   X   |
| Aegis         | Xander      |   X   |   X   |
| Pavise        | Frederick   |   X   |   X   |
| Sol           | Cordelia    |       |   X   |

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom, Trample (Camilla)

- These skills are wonderful damage boosters and Rowan uses them to great effect whether as an AI or controlled.
- At maximum Luck, Luna reduces Def/Res by 45%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Luck+20 (Celica), Str +10, Live to Serve (Lianna), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick)

- Armored Blow is pretty necessary for a player controlled unit, and Pass, while not as useful, is still nice to have.
- Aegis and Pavise reduce his damage taken vs the relevant weapons by roughly 33%.
- Luck +20 increases Luna Def/Res reduction to 50%, and Aegis/Pavise's damage reduction to 40%.
- Str +10 is a damage booster, plain and simple.
- Live to Serve can help his survivability, but keep in mind that taking less damage is more valuable in History Mode than healing it off.

#### Support Skills

Live to Serve (Lianna), Str +10 (Lianna), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Sol (Cordelia)

- Str +10, Aegis, and Pavise were covered in sufficient detail above.
- Sol and Live to Serve can help his survivability in the field, since damage AI characters take does not count against your damage total in History mode. Choose the one you like the best, as two sustain skills are a bit overkill.

### Lianna

| Skill         | Hero        |  PC   |  AI   |
| :------------ | :---------- | :---: | :---: |
| **Astra**     | **Ryoma**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Luna**      | **Chrom**   | **X** | **X** |
| **Trample**   | **Camilla** | **X** | **X** |
| Armored Blow  | Tiki        |   X   |       |
| Pass          | Lyn         |   X   |       |
| Luck +20      | Celica      |   X   |       |
| Mag +10       | Leo         |   X   |   X   |
| Live To Serve | Lianna      |   X   |   X   |
| Aegis         | Xander      |   X   |   X   |
| Pavise        | Frederick   |   X   |   X   |
| Sol           | Cordelia    |       |   X   |

#### Mandatory Skills

Astra (Ryoma), Luna (Chrom), Trample (Camilla)

- As with Rowan, Lianna uses these skills greatly.
- Her Luna also reduces foes' Def/Res by roughly 45% at maximum Luck.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Luck +20 (Celica), Mag +10 (Leo), Live to Serve (Lianna), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick)

- At maximum Luck, Aegis and Pavise reduce damage taken vs the relevant weapons by 33%.
- With Luck +20, Luna's Def/Res reduction is increased to roughly 50%, and Aegis/Pavise's damage reduction is increased to roughly 40%.
- Take Mag +10 over Str +10. Otherwise, these skills were covered sufficiently in Rowan's section.

#### Support Skills

Live to Serve (Lianna), Mag +10 (Leo), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Sol (Cordelia).

- These skills were covered sufficiently in above sections.

## Final Notes

In conclusion, Rowan and Lianna are solid all around units. Since they are allowed in most character-restricted maps, they effectively run a monopoly on the **Beastslayer** skill. There is really no reason to run it on anyone else considering their availability. In my opinion, Lianna has a slight edge over Rowan, being one of the few sword units to make good use of **Topsy-Turvy**. As I said earlier though, they are basically the same, so unless you need a magic sword user for whatever reason either one will do the trick. Be sure to run a different slayer on each of them to further differentiate the two.

# Chapter 2 — Lissa

Hello and welcome to another FE Warriors character guide. This time, I’ll be covering everyone’s favorite nun with an axe, Lissa.

#### Stats at Level 130 Promoted

| Stat | Value |
| :--- | ----: |
| HP   |   867 |
| Str  |    87 |
| Mag  |   129 |
| Skl  |    99 |
| Spe  |    96 |
| Lck  |   121 |
| Def  |    51 |
| Res  |   149 |

Right off the bat we can see that Lissa, despite her insistence to the contrary, is incredibly delicate. 51 defense at level 130 is bad, no two ways about it. However, she sports impressive Mag, meaning that with **Topsy-Turvy**, she will melt many of the low-resistance physical attackers that are otherwise strong against her.  Similarly, she has a gigantic Resistance stat, allowing her to win slugfests with magical enemies even if she is using **Topsy-Turvy**. Aside from her luck, the rest of her stats are pretty middling.

#### Staff

Always

#### Unique Weapon

None

#### Unique Skill

Str +10: increases Strength by 10.

#### Pair Up Bonuses as Support

Mag/Res/Luck (+5 if A/A+, otherwise +3)

## Moveset

**`C1`:** Lissa raises her axe above her head and gets pumped for battle. This combo does no damage on its own, but it boosts her Str, Mag, Def, and Res by 20% for about 30 seconds. Make sure you have this active when fighting tougher enemies. The buff is not affected by **Strong I**.

**`C2`:** Lissa does an upwards slash at close range, launching enemies hit. This is your run-of-the-mill launcher. Use it to set up juggles on neutral or bad matchups to break white stun gauges. It’s relatively unnecessary for yellow gauges.

**`C3`:** Lissa spins in a circle a few times, grabbing the first enemy hit. When the attack ends, she falls over for a few seconds. You can cancel this by dodging or pair swapping just at the right time, but that’s a lot of effort for a relatively mediocre combo.

**`C4`:** Lissa slashes with her axe and throws it a short distance in front of her. After a brief delay, the axe explodes with lightning, damaging nearby enemies and exposing stun gauges on any enemy that doesn’t have WTA over her. This is a pretty good combo, with decent area clear and utility. Use it to clear small areas of enemies or to set up a juggle.

**`C5`:** Lissa slams her axe into the ground, using the forward momentum to spin like a wheel, grabbing the first enemy hit and carrying them with her for the duration of the attack. This is in the running for one of the most fun moves in the entire game if only for the sheer absurdity of it. However, it’s also incredibly useful as it utterly devours officers and stun gauges.

**`C6`:** Lissa throws her axe like a boomerang around her, catches it, spins a few times, and slams it into the ground, causing an immense lightning explosion around her. This is a fantastic area clearer that basically combines her `C3` and `C4`, clearing both her immediate surroundings and a large area in front.

## Weapon Skills

- **Strong V**
- **Strong VI**
- **Rainstorm**
- **Topsy-Turvy**
- Choose One: **Pair Up+**, **Warrior+**, **Critical+**
- Choose One: **Strong IV**, **Awaken Gift**

**Strong V** and VI are her most versatile combos, devouring officers and crowds alike. Her regular combo is pretty powerful on its own, and **Rainstorm** boosts it further. **Topsy-Turvy** allows her to take advantage of her massive Mag stat. After that, choose your favorite of **Pair Up+**, Crit+, or **Warrior+**. Personally, I recommend **Pair Up+** for her. Given her physical frailty, she will often be reliant on dual guards to not take too much damage, so you might as well boost her damage at the same time. For your final slot, choose between **Strong IV** or **Awaken Gift**. `C4` doesn’t have the same crowd clearing potential as `C6`, but it does expose stun gauges. **Awaken Gift** can be handy in a pinch.

As an aside, given that Lissa has by far the highest resistance of any pre-DLC axe user, you could choose to opt out of using **Topsy-Turvy** and go full mage-hunter. Camilla’s magic is solid enough to pull off a **Topsy-Turvy** set in that case. I personally recommend against doing that, given that she can brute force her way through mages even with a magical weapon. However, if you don’t like playing as Lissa, she can function very well with a physical weapon as an AI, quickly hunting down mages and otherwise supporting allies with heals or as a pair up partner.

| Awakening     | Lucina      |   X   |       |
| Str +10       | Lissa       |       |   X   |
| Solidarity    | Robin       |       |   X   |
| Dracoshield   | Corrin      |       |   X   |

#### Mandatory Skills

- Astra (Ryoma)
- Luna (Chrom)
- Trample (Camilla)

These skills need no introduction, being the three most reliable damage boosting skills in the game. They are good on everyone all the time. At maximum Luck, Luna will reduce foes' Def/Res by 45%.

#### Vanguard Skills

Armored Blow (Tiki), Pass (Lyn), Aegis (Xander), Pavise (Frederick), Defense +10 (Hinoka), Live to Serve (Lianna), Mag +10 (Leo), Luck +20 (Celica), Awakening (Lucina)

- **Armored Blow is pretty much a must for any player controlled unit**, but the AI doesn’t really care much about it. Beyond that, it’s up to you.
- Pass allows uninterrupted approaches on anyone, particularly mages, who Lissa will be fighting a lot of.
- At maximum Luck, Aegis and Pavise reduce damage taken vs the relevant weapons by 33%.
- With Luck +20, Luna's Def/Res reduction is increased to roughly 50%, and Aegis/Pavise's damage reduction is increased to roughly 40%.
- Def +10 is a consistent booster that reduces the damage she takes fairly significantly.
- Live to Serve is a nifty choice to stay topped off while supporting allies.
- Mag +10 is a general damage booster.
- Awakening is more of a niche choice, but consider this especially if you decide to roll with **Awaken Gift**.
- A player controlled Lissa might want a friend with Dracoshield as a support partner in order to shore up her poor defense.

#### Support Skills

Live to Serve (Lianna), Luck +20 (Celica) Mag +10 (Leo), Str +10 (Lissa), Defense +10 (Hinoka), Solidarity (Robin), Dracoshield (Corrin)

- Live to Serve is a fair bit more valuable on an AI controlled unit, since they will definitely take damage doing whatever they are doing and not demand that another healer gets sent over to wherever they are. Alternatively, you can run Sol to sustain while battling across the field.
- Choose Mag +10 if using **Topsy-Turvy**, and Str +10 if you are going for a mage hunter physical set. Def +10 is an option to boost up her poor Defense to a more serviceable level.
- Solidarity and Dracoshield are worth running if you plan on having Lissa as a pair up buddy. This does limit her ability to heal, so be wary.

## Final Notes

That brings us to the end of the character guide for Lissa. She is personally one of my favorite characters to use, and I hope she is one of yours too!
